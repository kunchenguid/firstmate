# tests/fm-remote-secondmate-relaunch.test.sh - regression coverage for
# bin/fm-remote-secondmate-relaunch.sh: the parent-side tool an operator runs
# to move a remote secondmate onto a new harness, model, or effort.
#
# Reproduces the observed defect: running
# bin/fm-on.sh <id> fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh relaunch <id> <harness>
# <model> <effort> relaunches the agent on its host, but that host-local verb
# can only rewrite its own endpoint record. The parent's own state/<id>.meta
# kept naming the runtime the mate used to run. The wrapper drives the same
# host-local relaunch and then republishes this home's own record from the
# identity the host confirmed.
#
# The remote transport is faked at the SSH boundary, exactly as the other
# remote-secondmate suites fake it, rather than exercising a real host.
