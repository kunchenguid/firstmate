# Behavior tests for bin/fm-crew-state.sh — the deterministic crew-current-state
# helper.
#
# The status file (state/<id>.status) is a best-effort append-only EVENT LOG, so
# `tail -1` of it reports the last event, not the current state. fm-crew-state
# reads the AUTHORITATIVE source (an active no-mistakes run-step, else the pane
# busy-signature) and reconciles the possibly-stale log against it. These cases
# pin every branch of that logic, hermetically, over real throwaway git repos
# with a fake `no-mistakes` (run-step source) and a fake `tmux` (pane source):
#   (a) active run-step is authoritative                          -> run-step
#   (b) needs-decision/blocked log + resumed run = SUPERSEDED     -> run-step
#   (c) genuine parked run + needs-decision log = NOT superseded  -> run-step
#   (d) terminal run-step (passed/failed) is authoritative        -> run-step
#   (e) cross-branch attribution: this branch's own run found via list lookup
#   (f) no run + busy pane                                        -> pane
#   (g) no run + idle pane falls to the status-log verb           -> status-log
#   (h) dead pane ignores stale status log                         -> unknown/none
#   (i) kind=scout skips the run lookup                           -> pane/status-log
#   (j) torn-down worktree / missing meta                         -> unknown/none
