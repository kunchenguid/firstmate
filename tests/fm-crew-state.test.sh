# Behavior tests for bin/fm-crew-state.sh - the deterministic crew-current-state
# helper.
#
# The status file (state/<id>.status) is a best-effort append-only EVENT LOG, so
# `tail -1` of it reports the last event, not the current state. fm-crew-state
# reads the AUTHORITATIVE source (a matching no-mistakes run-step, else the
# semantic busy-state contract) and reconciles the possibly-stale log against it. These
# cases pin every branch of that logic, hermetically, over real throwaway git
# repos with a fake `no-mistakes` (run-step source) and a fake `tmux` (pane
# source):
#   (a) active run-step is authoritative                          -> run-step
#   (b) needs-decision/blocked log + resumed run = SUPERSEDED     -> run-step
#   (c) genuine parked run + needs-decision log = NOT superseded  -> run-step
#   (d) terminal run-step (passed/failed) is authoritative        -> run-step
#   (e) cross-branch attribution: this branch's own run found via list lookup
#   (f) no run + semantic busy                                    -> pane
#   (g) no run + semantic idle falls to the status-log verb       -> status-log
#   (h) dead pane: no run -> unknown/none; with a run -> run-step (not the shell)
#   (i) kind=scout skips the run lookup                           -> pane/status-log
#   (j) torn-down worktree / missing meta                         -> unknown/none
#   (k) crew_is_provably_working end-to-end over the REAL helper (not a canned
#       fake fm-crew-state.sh verdict): cross-branch attribution via the runs
#       list -> absorbed; genuinely no run anywhere + idle pane -> surfaced.
#       This is the direct regression pair for the 2026-07-02 herdr incident,
#       proving the watcher's own absorb-only-when-provably-working predicate
#       benefits from the fix in both directions.
