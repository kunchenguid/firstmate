# tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh - the always-on wake triage built into
# bin/fm-watch.sh and the shared classifier (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh). The watcher
# absorbs the benign majority of wakes in bash and exits ONLY on an actionable
# wake, so firstmate's LLM re-arms once per actionable event instead of once per
# wake. These tests cover the classifier predicates as pure functions, then drive
# a real fm-watch.sh subprocess to assert the behavioral contract:
# provably-working no-verb wakes absorbed (no exit, no queue entry, suppressor
# advanced, beacon fresh), stopped-crew no-verb wakes surfaced (queue + exit),
# the liveness probe (agent-gone alarms, progress-evidence refutation with
# backoff, the flat split's idle-finish and no-progress alarms, machine wait
# field silencing and single-fire expiry, secondmates never probed), the
# heartbeat backstop fail-safe, and afk coherence (no double-triage while the
# away-mode daemon owns supervision).
#
# Daemon-side classification/injection lives in fm-daemon.test.sh; watcher/lock
# liveness in fm-watcher-lock.test.sh; the durable-queue safety matrix in
# fm-wake-queue.test.sh.

# --- process-event delivery -------------------------------------------------
# A durably captured process-event result publishes an ordinary `check` wake on
# the durable queue. The watcher must deliver that queued wake proactively -
# print an actionable reason and exit into the same rewake path every other
# actionable wake uses - rather than leaving it to be found by a manual drain.

# Run the runner against a case home. FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE (exported by the shared
# wake harness to keep the drain's tangle check inert) would otherwise point the
# runner at a root with no installed adapters, and the claim root must stay
# inside the case so nothing here can observe a real home's source ownership.
