# tests/fm-classify-decision-key.test.sh - decision-key position tolerance in
# the open-decisions fold (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh). A "[key=<slug>]" token is
# documented between the verb and the colon (needs-decision [key=x]: note), but
# workers commonly write the colon first (needs-decision: [key=x] note); that
# stated key must be honored, never silently folded into the shared "default"
# bucket where an answer can close the wrong record (issue #2109). These tests
# drive the REAL status_open_decisions / status_open_decisions_incremental
# functions over crafted status files and assert their folded output, never the
# fold's own source text. Cross-drain cursor persistence and the incremental
# cost bound live in tests/fm-wake-drain-open-decisions-cursor.test.sh; the
# drain wiring lives in tests/fm-wake-drain-open-decisions.test.sh.
