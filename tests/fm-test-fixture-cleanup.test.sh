# Behavior tests for tests/lib.sh's shared fixture-tempdir helper
# (fm_test_tmproot / fm_test_cleanup / fm_test_reap_orphans).
#
# The near-universal call pattern across this suite is
# `TMP_ROOT=$(fm_test_tmproot prefix)`, which forks a subshell to capture the
# function's stdout. These tests spawn real, separate bash processes that use
# that exact pattern and assert the fixture root is actually gone once the
# owning process's guarded teardown has run - on a normal exit and on a
# terminating signal - plus that a stale marked fixture from a killed prior
# run gets reaped on the next source. Nothing here inspects tests/lib.sh's
# source text; it only observes filesystem state around the real helper.
