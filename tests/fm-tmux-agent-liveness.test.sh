# tests/fm-tmux-agent-liveness.test.sh - portable regression for the tmux
# agent-liveness classifier (bin/backends/tmux.sh).
#
# It runs REAL processes in a REAL tmux server on a private socket (`-L`), and
# needs no harness and no credentials, so it runs everywhere CI runs tmux. The
# live per-harness counterpart is tests/fm-harness-liveness-drift-live-e2e.test.sh.
#
# The defect it exists for: a harness that rewrites its own process title made
# `#{pane_current_command}` report a version string, the classifier could not
# attribute the pane, and supervision lost the agent. The version-string case
# below carries the proof that the verdict never depends on a single name
# surface: it drives the two sources apart on purpose and asserts that
# divergence, so it cannot go quietly vacuous. tmux and `ps -o comm=` read
# different name surfaces, and which one a given construction blinds differs
# between macOS and Linux, so every case asserts only the platform-independent
# property that the verdict itself is correct.
