# tests/fm-bearings-board-lavish-live-e2e.test.sh - token-free live drift guard
# proving the real lavish-axi still emits the non-opening session shapes that
# bin/fm-bearings-board.sh relies on.
#
# Why this file exists: the build's "is this board actually live" verdict comes
# from vendor-controlled output. A stubbed lavish-axi can only confirm the
# assumption already written into the stub, so the assumption itself needs a
# run against the real tool.
#
# The captain-ended state is reached through the same server route the browser's
# End session button calls. Session creation and inspection both use --no-open,
# so this guard never creates a browser tab. The portable board suite owns open,
# reopen, same-tab update, and redundant-open refusal through public interfaces
# with a protocol-shaped stub that cannot touch a real browser.
#
# Standard CI has no lavish-axi, so this reports a capability skip there. The
# portable counterpart in tests/fm-bearings-board.test.sh pins the build's logic
# in CI against a stub that reproduces these shapes. Run this guard after a
# lavish-axi upgrade and before trusting refreshed evidence.
