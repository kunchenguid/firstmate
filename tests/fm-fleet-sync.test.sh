# Behavior tests for fm-fleet-sync.sh drift handling.
#
# fm-fleet-sync fast-forwards a clone that is cleanly on its default branch. This
# suite pins the two behavioral additions on top of that:
#   - the one safe drift self-heals: a clean, detached HEAD that holds no unique
#     commits (it is an ancestor of origin/<default>) and whose <default> is free
#     to check out is re-attached and then fast-forwarded ("recovered:").
#   - every other off-default state is left untouched and reported as a loud,
#     quantified "STUCK: ... N commits behind ... - needs attention" warning
#     instead of a quiet skip.
# The pre-existing fast-forward / already-current / local-only / no-origin paths
# must be unchanged, and bootstrap must relay the new outcomes as FLEET_SYNC lines.
#
# It also pins the orphaned .git/packed-refs.lock recovery in the fetch step
# (fetch_with_packed_refs_lock_guard, backed by bin/fm-lock-lib.sh's shared
# staleness proof): a provably-stale lock is retried then removed and the clone
# syncs (with a "recovered:" summary on stdout so a session-start refresh, which
# discards stderr, still surfaces it); a live lock (fake lsof holder) is never
# removed and the sync fails loudly; a live process merely holding the clone
# worktree dir as its cwd also blocks removal (the clone-dir liveness check); a
# transient lock that self-clears is retried without a force-remove; and any
# non-packed-refs.lock fetch failure keeps today's behavior with no retry.
