# Shared worktree-tangle guard for the firstmate-on-itself case.
# Usage: . bin/fm-tangle-lib.sh
#
# Firstmate is a treehouse-pooled git repo of itself: crewmate worktrees and
# secondmate homes are all linked `git worktree`s of the same repo, while the
# PRIMARY checkout (the repo root firstmate operates from) is a normal checkout
# on a real branch - normally the default branch, main. The "worktree tangle"
# failure mode is a crewmate spawned to work on firstmate ITSELF branching and
# committing in the primary checkout instead of its own disposable worktree,
# stranding the primary on a feature branch (e.g. fm/readme-restructure-d3).
#
# fm_primary_tangle_branch detects exactly that and nothing else: a NAMED,
# non-default branch checked out in the given root. It is deliberately silent for
# every legitimate state - the primary on its default branch, and detached HEAD,
# which is how every linked worktree and secondmate home legitimately sits on the
# default branch. Detached HEAD on the default is fine; a feature branch in a
# primary checkout is the alarm.

# Resolve the default branch name of the git repo at <dir>: prefer origin/HEAD,
# then fall back to a local main/master. Echoes the name, or returns 1.
#
# origin/HEAD is only trusted when the branch it names actually exists. A clone
# whose remote advertised a default branch that was later renamed or deleted
# keeps a DANGLING symbolic ref (seen live: refs/remotes/origin/HEAD ->
# refs/remotes/origin/main in a repo that only publishes build/production).
# `symbolic-ref` resolves that ref happily, so an unvalidated read invents a
# default branch name no caller can ever check out, diff, or merge into.
# Verifying the target keeps resolution honest: an unusable origin/HEAD falls
# through to the local candidates and, failing those, returns 1 so callers
# refuse with their own "cannot determine default branch" error instead of
# operating against a branch that does not exist.
