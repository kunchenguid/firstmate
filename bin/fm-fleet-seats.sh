# fm-fleet-seats.sh - opt-in fleet-wide active-agent seat pools for shared model endpoints.
#
# docs/configuration.md "Fleet seat pools" owns the operator contract: the
# config/fleet-seats schema, what a seat is, which homes share one pool, and
# what the refusals mean. This header owns the mechanics; it is the single
# owner of the seat record format, counting, and every seat transition.
# Callers supply evidence and request an operation; they never write or delete
# seat records themselves.
#
# A seat is an active agent slot on a pooled model, never an inference
# request. Its holder is keyed by canonical state directory plus task id.
#
# THE AUTHORITY. Every home resolves the one fleet root with
# fm_firstmate_root_home (bin/fm-wake-lib.sh): the primary is its own root, and
# a local secondmate walks its .fm-secondmate-parent binding to the primary.
# The root's config/fleet-seats declares the pools, and every grant is decided
# under the root's lock (<root>/state/.fleet-seats.lock). A home whose walk
# ends at a remote parent binding shares that host root's ledger and lock with
# its local descendants, and receives policy and grants from the primary
# (REMOTE HOMES below).
#
# THE LEDGER. Each holder is one record at
# <authority-state>/fleet-seats/holders/<seat-name>.json, where <seat-name> is
# derived from the canonical state directory plus task id and the embedded key
# is validated on every access (a hash collision refuses). Schema
# fm-fleet-seat-holder.v2:
#   {schema, state_dir, task, revision, incarnations: [{generation,
#    previous_generation, kind, model, policy_digest_at_reserve, lifecycle,
#    launch_phase, owner_pid, owner_pid_identity, route, startup_confirmed,
#    disposition, [legacy], [requested_model]}]}
# Every state is per holder + generation. lifecycle is reserved | confirmed
# (both count) | released | reclaimed (neither counts); launch_phase refines
# reserved as prepared -> dispatching -> started, with unknown for a
# conservatively imported record. revision increases on every atomic mutation.
# Pools are never storage directories: a pool's count is the number of
# distinct holder keys with a nonterminal incarnation whose model the CURRENT
# policy maps to that pool (a null model - an imported unresolved legacy model
# - occupies every pool). Two generations of one holder in one pool count once;
# an old and a candidate generation in different pools count in both until the
# old one is terminal.
#
# Transitions (only this script writes them, each a short compare-and-set
# under the ledger lock):
#   absent/terminal -> reserved   reserve, with a NEW generation and a capacity
#                                 check; a same-generation same-model retry is
#                                 idempotent; a terminal generation never revives.
#                                 A nonterminal incarnation other than the named
#                                 --previous-generation refuses: retry reconciles
#                                 the existing candidate instead of replacing it.
#   prepared -> dispatching       dispatch, by the reserving owner (or its
#                                 descendant) before any launch delivery; only
#                                 the first dispatch is permitted.
#   reserved -> confirmed         confirm, on this script's own recovery-grade
#                                 `alive` reading of the dispatched local route.
#   reserved -> released          release --reason prelaunch (never dispatched)
#                                 or cancelled (dispatched endpoint proven gone).
#   nonterminal -> released       release --reason replaced (a candidate naming
#                                 this generation as previous exists and its
#                                 confirmed agent stopped or endpoint is proven
#                                 destroyed) or teardown (cleanup no longer
#                                 binds the task record to this generation).
#   nonterminal -> reclaimed      reclaim, recovery with fresh generation-bound
#                                 endpoint or host-operation evidence.
#   remote operations             reconcile-remote applies one host disposition.
# No transition is inferred from reserving-process death, session-lock
# absence, a timestamp, missing metadata, a model mismatch, transport failure,
# or a shell-only `dead` reading of a submitted launch: those can trigger
# reconciliation but never free capacity. Counting is side-effect free.
#
# COUNTING AT THE ROOT. Under the root lock, a pool's holders are the union of:
#   - nonterminal ledger holders mapped to the pool, as above;
#   - UNMANAGED pooled task records in the root home and local descendants
#     (reached through each home's data/secondmates.md): a record is managed,
#     and so ignored here, when a ledger holder exists for its key; a record
#     generation (spawn_gen=, or fleet_seat_generation= on a remote route) that
#     conflicts with every ledger incarnation fails admission closed. An
#     unmanaged ship or scout counts while its record is pooled; an unmanaged
#     local secondmate counts unless its session lock is free or stale and its
#     endpoint reads dead or missing; an unresolved model counts everywhere.
#   - the primary supervisor, keyed "<root-state>\t.primary", when the root's
#     config/fleet-seats declares "primary_model" in a pool and the root's
#     session lock is not provably free or stale (bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh).
#     A running primary is never refused or preempted.
#   - for each registered remote secondmate, the rows of its last complete
#     serve certificate, remote-<id>.cert.
# The root refuses (exit 5) instead of counting when any registered remote has
# a pending serve, no certificate, or a certificate for another policy digest;
# a registry line cannot be parsed; a home cannot be listed; a task record or
# holder record cannot be read.
#
# REMOTE HOMES. The root's serve-remotes (run from the root's watcher) serves
# each registered remote through bin/fm-on.sh outside the root lock:
#   - it allocates a serve epoch "<issuer>.<seq>" (a stable root issuer id plus
#     a per-remote sequence persisted under the root lock), writes
#     remote-<id>.pending carrying that epoch BEFORE the call - which
#     invalidates the previous certificate even across a crash or timeout -
#     releases the lock and sends the pool declaration with the digest, epoch, and each
#     pool's allowance (capacity minus every other holder, 0 while another
#     remote is unconfirmed), then reacquires the lock, validates and publishes it
#     atomically as remote-<id>.cert, and only then clears the matching
#     pending marker. Lost, truncated, or mismatched output leaves the pending
#     marker, so admission stays refused; an old response cannot clear a newer
#     marker. A counter or issuer that cannot be reconciled with existing
#     certificates refuses rather than restarting the sequence.
#   - under the remote's own lock, serve refuses an epoch lower than its
#     highest applied one and replays an exact same-epoch/digest response
#     without granting anything, stores the delivered policy, rejects stale
#     requests, grants waiting requests in arrival order within the allowance
#     (a request from a holder already counted in that pool is one slot),
#     creating the granted holder record, and prints one JSON certificate
#     {schema:"fm-fleet-seats-serve.v2", policy_digest, epoch, complete:true,
#     holders:[{state_dir, task, generation, model, lifecycle}]} listing every
#     reserved or confirmed generation, including unmanaged pooled records.
#   - a remote reserve files a request carrying its generation and waits
#     (bounded) for the root's next serve to confirm that exact policy and
#     model; pooled requests also require the grant. A timeout withdraws the
#     request and refuses unless the grant landed first.
#
# REMOTE SUPERVISORS. A remote secondmate's own seat is parent-owned: the
# parent reserves it at the root, dispatches it with a remote route carrying
# the host operation token, and applies the host's token-scoped disposition
# with reconcile-remote. Host-side records under state/parent-route are
# execution receipts, not counted holders (bin/fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh).
#
# EXPLICIT MODELS. While any pool is configured, every launch needs a verified
# explicit model. A harness default or raw launch command cannot prove its
# actual model and refuses before dispatch.
#
# SUPERVISOR EPISODES. Every mutation of a kind=secondmate holder adopts the
# caller's verified lifecycle carrier or takes the task's lifecycle mutex
# without waiting (bin/fm-secondmate-liveness-lib.sh), refusing while another
# episode holds it. Lock order: lifecycle episode, then task metadata (reclaim
# only), then the ledger lock; this script never takes a lifecycle or metadata
# lock while holding the ledger lock and never probes a host from inside it.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh reserve <id> --generation <gen> [--previous-generation <gen|->]
#       --harness <harness> --model <model|default> --holder-pid <pid>
#       [--kind ship|scout|secondmate] [--raw-launch]
#       Prints nothing and exits 0 with no declaration for a new holder key.
#       Existing holders still record successors during policy opt-out.
#       With a declaration, records the holder and prints
#       "fleet-seats: reserved pool=..." (pooled) or "fleet-seats: recorded ..."
#       (a model in no pool).
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh dispatch <id> --generation <gen> --route-file <private-json>
#       Exit 0 "fleet-seats: dispatched ..." permits the one launch delivery;
#       exit 3 "already-dispatched" forbids delivering again.
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh confirm <id> --generation <gen>
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh release <id> --generation <gen> --reason <prelaunch|cancelled|replaced|teardown>
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh reclaim <id> --generation <gen> [--state-dir <canonical-state>]
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh reconcile-remote <id> --generation <gen> --response-file <private-json>
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh reconcile --limit <n>
#       Bounded maintenance: try reclaim on up to <n> holders whose owner has
#       ended, skipping busy episodes; nothing is killed to free a seat.
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh show <id>
#       Print this home's holder record for <id> (read-only).
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh serve-remotes
#       Root only (a no-op anywhere else): serve every registered remote
#       secondmate and print one "served <id> ..." or "unreachable <id>" line
#       each. A remote that failed is skipped for a fixed backoff.
#   fm-fleet-seats.sh serve --digest <digest> --epoch <epoch> [--allowance <pool>=<n>]...
#       Remote home only; the root runs it through bin/fm-on.sh with the pool
#       declaration on stdin.
#
# Private carrier files (--route-file, --response-file) must be regular,
# non-symlink files owned by the caller with no group or other access.
# A route object is {placement, backend, target, home, host, remote_root,
# spawn_gen, operation} with placement local|remote and remote-only fields
# null locally. A host disposition response is the
# fm-remote-seat-operation.v2 object bin/fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh prints.
#
# Fixed bounds: 30s lock wait, 90s remote request wait, 20s per remote serve
# or disposition call, 120s backoff after a failed serve.
# FM_FLEET_SEATS_TEST_REMOTE_WAIT and FM_FLEET_SEATS_TEST_BACKOFF shorten the
# second and last for the regression suite only; they are not operator
# settings.
#
# Environment: FM_HOME, FM_STATE_OVERRIDE, FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE, and
# FM_DATA_OVERRIDE resolve the calling home as the other bin/ scripts do; they
# also select the root's own directories when the caller is the root.
#
# Exit status: 0 reserved, not pooled, transitioned, nothing held, or served;
# 2 usage error; 3 the evidence is uncertain and the seat stays counted (or a
# dispatch was already made); 4 the pool is full; 5 the accounting authority is
# unreachable, unconfirmed, unreadable, busy, or misconfigured, an explicit
# model is required, or the transition is refused. Exit 4 and 5 from reserve
# both mean no seat: choose another route.
