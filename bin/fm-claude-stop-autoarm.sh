# Claude Stop-owned watcher auto-arm (asyncRewake hook).
#
# Registered in tracked .claude/settings.json as a Stop command hook with
# "asyncRewake": true and an explicit multi-hour timeout. Claude Code fires it
# in the background on EVERY Stop of a Claude primary session, with no
# deduplication across firings. It owns routine tokenless watcher continuity
# for Claude primaries (main home and marked secondmate homes):
#
#   - Scope: only a genuine primary checkout (plain checkout or validly marked
#     secondmate home) with AGENTS.md, bin/, and the effective state dir - the
#     exact fm-turnend-guard.sh scope. Child crew/scout worktrees stay inert.
#   - Identity: only when THIS session's harness ancestor holds state/.lock.
#     When an existing numeric owner fails the shared harness-liveness predicate,
#     the hook delegates guarded recovery to bin/fm-lock.sh and then re-verifies
#     ownership. A live owner, missing lock, malformed lock, or unresolved
#     ancestry remains inert, so a competing session never arms or rewakes.
#   - AFK: while state/.afk exists the away daemon owns the watcher and triage;
#     this hook exits 0 and NEVER rewakes the primary (checked again at
#     translation time so a mid-cycle AFK transition is honored).
#   - Need: arms only while the home needs supervision, as
#     bin/fm-supervision-lib.sh defines it; an idle home exits 0.
#   - Single-flight: Claude does not dedupe async hooks, so exactly one
#     GENERATION owner arms per event epoch: the epoch ledger's monotonic
#     sequence is the claim generation, every firing defers (exit 0) to a live
#     open claim, and a stuck, dead, identity-mismatched, or finished claim is
#     superseded by taking the next generation instead of being unlocked or
#     revoked. No mutex is ever held across arming or output - the owner lock
#     survives only as the micro-mutex serializing individual ledger writes -
#     and a superseded owner goes completely silent: ownership is re-verified
#     before every arm invocation, episode-state mutation, ledger write, and
#     continuation (fm_autoarm_claim_open/fm_autoarm_claim_next in
#     bin/fm-wake-lib.sh own the contract, including the legacy shim for a
#     pre-generation lock).
#   - Foreground arm: the owner runs bin/fm-watch-arm.sh in the FOREGROUND of
#     this hook-owned process tree (never shell &); Claude owns the process
#     group, so its timeout/session teardown kills arm and watcher together.
#   - Translation: while supervision is still needed and AFK remains inactive,
#     an actionable arm close (signal:/stale:/check:/heartbeat) prints one
#     rewake banner to stderr and exits 2, which wakes Claude even while idle
#     ("Stop hook feedback"). The irrevocable commit point is the EXIT STATUS:
#     the harness delivers the collected stderr only on exit 2, so an owned
#     terminal commit decides the exit. Markerless outcomes commit with the
#     ledger write; the failure notice additionally requires its marker write.
#     A refused generation exits 0 silently even after printing. A close that
#     reports no actionable reason is benign when a live identity-matched
#     watcher still has a fresh beacon.
#   - Failure handling: a typed failure is rechecked against the same live,
#     fresh watcher predicate and retried a bounded number of times in this
#     hook. Only an exhausted failure with no verified watcher emits one
#     last-resort notice per failure episode; later consecutive failures still
#     exit 2 to guarantee the next Stop-owned retry, carrying the shorter
#     suppressed-continuation line rather than repeating the full notice, until
#     the synchronous guard has consumed its attended fail-open.
#   - No silent block: EVERY exit 2 names a cause on stderr. Exit 2 blocks the
#     turn and the collected stderr is the operator's only view of why, so a
#     blocking path that prints nothing leaves the home re-waking forever with
#     no message naming a cause - the exact undiagnosable loop a state
#     directory that cannot hold restricted modes used to produce. Episode
#     deduplication applies to the FULL notice, never to the block itself.
#
# The epoch ledger state/.claude-autoarm-epoch records the latest claim
# generation and outcome so the synchronous Stop guard
# (bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude) can allow a stop whose recovery this hook
# already owns, instead of forcing a duplicate continuation for the same event
# epoch. The failure marker
# state/.claude-autoarm-failure-notified deduplicates the last-resort notice,
# and state/.claude-autoarm-failure-alarmed bounds the attended fail-open and
# suppresses any later automatic continuation in that unresolved episode.
#
# This hook never blocks the Stop decision itself and never prints to stdout:
# exit 0 is always silent, and exit 2 always carries its reason on stderr.
# On any uncertainty such as unresolvable ancestry, malformed lock state, or
# lock contention, it exits 0 and leaves continuity to the synchronous guard and
# the model.
