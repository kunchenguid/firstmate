# Single owner of the "has this worktree's committed work actually LANDED"
# proof: reachable from a remote-tracking branch is checked by the caller
# before this is ever consulted (a fork counts as a remote), so this owns only
# the two remaining ways unreachable-from-any-remote work can still be landed -
# a merged PR whose head contains the current local work, or the branch's
# content already present in the up-to-date default branch (the common
# squash-merge-then-delete-branch flow). A gh lookup error, or no PR at all,
# falls back to the content check; if that is also inconclusive, work_is_landed
# reports unlanded rather than guess.
#
# Sourced by bin/fm-teardown.sh, whose worktree safety gate refuses to discard
# unpushed commits work_is_landed cannot prove landed (see that script's header
# for the full refusal contract), and by bin/fm-inactive-reconcile.sh, which
# asks the same question for a ship task fm-crew-state.sh could not itself
# resolve to done or failed (no no-mistakes run attributed and an unreadable
# endpoint - fm-crew-state.sh's own header, step 5 - is exactly how a genuinely
# landed but stale task reads).
#
# Callers set the plain (non-local) globals WT (the worktree to inspect) and
# PROJ (the project checkout default_branch resolves against) before calling;
# PR_URL, when pre-set from a recorded pr= meta field, is preferred over a
# branch-name PR lookup and is left holding the resolved PR URL on a landed
# verdict from a merged PR.
#
# Usage: . bin/fm-landing-lib.sh

# Resolved at source time from BASH_SOURCE, like fm-classify-lib.sh, rather
# than reusing a caller's own SCRIPT_DIR, so sourcing this never depends on or
# clobbers a caller's variable of that name.
