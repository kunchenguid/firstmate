# fm-secondmate-restart-lib.sh - the shared contract for restarting a second
# mate onto a freshly advanced instruction surface. Source only.
#
# Two consumers, one owner:
#   - bin/fm-update.sh decides WHICH advanced mates belong in the restart set,
#     so it needs the capability test before it prints its action lines.
#   - bin/fm-secondmate-restart.sh performs the pass, so it needs the same test
#     again on its own argv rather than trusting a caller's list.
#
# The capability test is the pre-stop half of the control plane's own refusals
# (bin/fm-control-lib.sh owns those tables): a mate whose recorded backend has
# no recovery-grade agent-state classifier, or whose harness has no verified
# control mechanics, can never have "the old agent stopped and the replacement
# came up" proven for it. Asking here keeps that verdict on the side of the
# transaction where nothing has been touched yet, so an incapable mate is routed
# to the ordinary re-read nudge instead of being stopped for a launch that must
# be refused.
#
# Placement is resolved from the same remote_host= signal bin/fm-send.sh routes
# on, and it changes only the transport: the restart itself is bin/fm-control.sh
# <id> relaunch either way, run here for a local mate and run on the host over
# bin/fm-on.sh for a remote one.

# The persist request the primary sends before it restarts anything. It is the
# open-record half of /stow and nothing more: a restart needs the state of work
# written down, not a memory curation pass, and bundling one would make every
# instruction update cost far more than the reload it is paying for.
# The mate answers through its parent channel, which is what resolves the
# parent-owned reply expectation fm-send arms for a marked request; that
# correlated answer, never the wall clock, is what releases the restart.
FM_SECONDMATE_PERSIST_REQUEST='Firstmate instructions changed and I am about to restart your agent so it reloads them, which drops your conversation but keeps every durable record. Before that, persist the open work you are holding only in this conversation, following the /stow skill'"'"'s "Open-record persistence" section and nothing else from that skill: file a task for each open record that exists only in this conversation, including any captain call you had formed but never registered, and correct any task whose status no longer reflects what you now know. Do NOT run the memory, learnings, or captain-preference sweeps. Then reply on your parent channel saying it is done, or saying what you deliberately left alone and why.'
