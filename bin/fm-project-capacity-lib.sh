# fm-project-capacity-lib.sh - how many workers a project admits at once on this
# machine, and whether a fresh worker spawn still fits.
#
# A project can depend on a machine-local resource that only a few workers can
# use at the same time: a heavy test suite, a local editor stack, a device.
# Firstmate cannot see which part of a worker's life touches that resource, so
# the captain declares how many workers the project admits on this machine, and
# bin/fm-spawn.sh defers a fresh worker beyond that number instead of launching
# it only to spend full-context turns retrying the resource. A deferred task
# keeps its queued backlog item and is dispatched again when a place frees.
# Without a declaration nothing changes and dispatch stays uncapped
# (AGENTS.md section 7).
#
# This file is the single owner of the declaration format, of what holds a
# place, and of the admission verdict. docs/configuration.md "Project capacity"
# is the operator reference, and bin/fm-spawn.sh owns where the check runs.
#
# Declaration: config/project-capacity in the local root Firstmate home (the home
# bin/fm-wake-lib.sh's fm_firstmate_root_home resolves), so every home on this
# machine reads the same number for the same machine's resources. One line per
# project:
#   <project-name> <capacity>
# <project-name> is the project's registered name, which is the basename of its
# clone directory, and <capacity> is a positive integer of at most six digits.
# Blank lines and lines whose first non-blank character is # are ignored. Any
# other shape, a project named twice, or an unreadable file makes the whole
# declaration unreadable, and bin/fm-spawn.sh then refuses every fresh ship or
# scout spawn from this machine's homes rather than guessing which limit was
# meant.
#
# Occupancy: a place is held by every task record, in any local Firstmate home on
# this machine (fm_local_firstmate_state_dirs in bin/fm-wake-lib.sh), that
#   - is not a secondmate, which is a persistent home rather than a worker,
#   - names the same project identity, meaning its project resolves to the same
#     shared project lock path (fm_treehouse_project_lock_path), which is keyed
#     by the project's resolved origin, so workers in any clone of that origin
#     are counted, and
#   - has no recorded PR handoff: the pr= line bin/fm-pr-check.sh records when a
#     worker's PR is ready, after which the worker waits on review or merge and
#     no longer uses local resources.
# A place therefore frees when a PR-based ship records its ready PR, or when any
# task is cleaned up and its record removed. A local-only ship and a scout have
# no recorded handoff and hold their place until cleanup. A worker that is
# steered back into work after its PR handoff is not counted again.
# The declaration is matched by the spawning clone's directory name, so clones
# of one origin share the cap only when they use that same directory name. A
# clone of that origin under a different directory name finds no declaration
# and is not capped, though its workers still count as holders for a
# same-origin clone that is capped.
# A record whose project directory no longer exists cannot be matched and holds
# no place. Remote homes are never walked, because their workers run on another
# machine.
#
# Race safety: bin/fm-spawn.sh evaluates admission while holding the shared
# project lock and keeps holding it until the new task record is published, so
# two concurrent spawns for one project can never both publish from the same
# count. Freeing a place needs no lock, because removing a record or adding pr=
# only ever lowers the count.
#
# Requires bin/fm-wake-lib.sh (root home, local homes, project lock path) and
# bin/fm-backend.sh (fm_meta_get) to be sourced first. No side effects on source.

# Exit status of a spawn deferred because the project is at capacity: the
# sysexits "temporary failure" code, so a caller can tell a deferral that leaves
# the task queued from an ordinary failure.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034 # read by bin/fm-spawn.sh after sourcing.
