#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-timeout-lib.sh - the single owner of bounded command execution.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Provides one hard-bound runner so no caller has to
# re-derive the coreutils/BSD/perl selection, and so every bounded call in this
# repo agrees on what "the bound was hit" means.
#
#   fm_timeout_mechanism
#       Prints the mechanism fm_run_timed will use on this host: "timeout",
#       "gtimeout", "perl", or "none". A caller that must not silently lose its
#       work when no bound is available inspects this FIRST and decides; a
#       caller for whom an unbounded call is worse than no call at all can
#       ignore it and treat fm_run_timed's 124 as the refusal.
#
#   fm_run_timed <seconds> <command> [args...]
#       Runs the command with a hard bound. Exit status is the command's own,
#       except 124, which means the bound was hit (GNU timeout's convention,
#       reproduced by the perl fallback). Returns 124 WITHOUT running anything
#       when this host has no bounding mechanism at all - see
#       fm_timeout_mechanism above.
#
# A non-positive bound is not a bound: `timeout 0` and the perl fallback's
# `alarm 0` both disable the deadline, so callers must reject 0 before calling.
#
# All three mechanisms terminate the whole process GROUP, not just the direct
# child, so a hung grandchild (a vendor CLI spawned by a wrapper script, a git
# fetch spawned by a sweep) cannot outlive the bound. GNU/BSD `timeout` does
# this by default because it does not run the command in the foreground process
# group; the perl fallback does it explicitly with setpgrp plus a negative pid.
