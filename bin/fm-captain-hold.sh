# fm-captain-hold.sh - deterministic mechanics for tasks held for the captain.
#
# The semantic policy is owned once by
# .agents/skills/captain-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md. This script never reads
# report, visual-review, chat, or terminal prose to guess whether the captain
# owes an answer. The invoking agent decides what is genuinely waiting on the
# captain; this script supplies guarded creation, a durable record of what the
# captain actually said, the investigation completion gate, and the one
# keyed-answer intake every channel feeds.
#
# There is no separate decision type. A captain call is an ordinary backlog
# task held for the captain through this script's mandatory `hold` subcommand,
# and its identity is simply the task id. Older installs created derived
# `<origin>-decision-<key>` identities through bin/fm-decision-hold.sh; those
# rows are already plain task ids, so they keep working here unchanged, and
# the legacy inputs noted below resolve them without a migration.
# All backlog reads and mutations address the active home's configured data
# directory the way bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh does, which keeps main-home
# and secondmate-home ownership aligned with the work that discovered the call.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-captain-hold.sh hold <task-id> --reason <reason> \
#     [--title <title>] [--repo <repo>] [--origin <origin-id>] [--until YYYY-MM-DD]
#   fm-captain-hold.sh answer <task-id> --decision-file <path> [--release]
#   fm-captain-hold.sh answers [<legacy-origin> | --any-origin] --source <provenance>   (keyed answers on stdin)
#   fm-captain-hold.sh bind <source-id> [<legacy-origin> | --any-origin]
#   fm-captain-hold.sh unbind <source-id>
#   fm-captain-hold.sh binding <source-id>
#   fm-captain-hold.sh complete <origin-id> (--none | <task-id>...)
#   fm-captain-hold.sh verify <origin-id>
#   fm-captain-hold.sh open <task-id>
#   fm-captain-hold.sh diverged
#
# `hold` places an existing task under an active captain hold, or creates the
# task first when no work item exists to hold (--title required to create; the
# optional --origin records provenance in the new task's body and supplies the
# default repo from that origin's metadata). Prefer holding the work item the
# question gates over minting a new row. The command records a UTC `Captain
# hold set:` timestamp in the task body: repeating an active hold preserves the
# existing timestamp, while re-holding released work starts a new lifecycle.
# A task already closed is refused rather than reopened. `--until` records the
# captain's own deferral date through `tasks-axi hold --until`, so a "revisit
# later" answer is stored as a date instead of a live card.
#
# `answer` records the captain's exact words and closes the call in the same
# act. It requires a non-empty captain decision file of at most 8192 bytes and
# writes a resolution block while preserving the leading hold-set stamp until
# the close succeeds (the previous body is preserved and archived through
# tasks-axi --archive-body). It then closes the task with `tasks-axi done` - or,
# with `--release`, lifts the hold with `tasks-axi unhold` so a captain-gated
# WORK item resumes instead of closing - and restores resolution-first body
# ordering. An exact retry also completes unfinished ordering normalization and
# is idempotent only when its requested close mode
# matches the newest record; a changed decision or a mode mismatch is rejected.
# A re-held task may record a new answer on top. On a task already closed outside this script,
# `answer` records the missing resolution block (the old `repair` path) only
# when the task still carries the captain-hold provenance tasks-axi preserves
# through a close, so an ordinary finished task cannot be dressed up as an
# answered captain call. A hold that expired by date (`--until` in the past) is
# still answerable: the surviving hold annotations, not tasks-axi's live
# `held:` bit, prove the captain owned it.
#
# ONE KEYED-ANSWER INTAKE, FED BY EVERY CHANNEL.
# "A keyed answer closes its matching captain-held task" is a single
# capability, owned here and nowhere else. `answers` reads
# `<task-id>\t<answer>\t<label>[\t<mode>]` lines on stdin and closes each named
# task through the very same `answer` path above, so every guard applies
# identically no matter which channel the answer arrived on. The key IS the
# task id - no identity arithmetic. The optional fourth field selects the close:
# empty or `done` completes the task, `release` lifts the hold so held work
# resumes; anything else is skipped. A key that names no task, a task that is
# not held for the captain, or a task already closed is reported as `skipped:`
# and feeds nothing. A replayed delivery whose answer digest and requested
# close mode both match the newest record is reported `closed:` and is a no-op;
# a mode mismatch is skipped. The command exits nonzero when any key was
# skipped. `--source` is provenance text recorded in the
# durable decision, never a behavior switch: this command has no per-channel
# branch and no knowledge of chat, review decks, or any transport.
# Legacy input: an optional positional origin (or a stored concrete-origin
# binding) makes a key that names no task fall back to the old
# `<origin>-decision-<key>` identity, so an in-flight pre-collapse channel
# keeps closing its rows; `--any-origin` and the stored `(any)` marker mean
# what an absent origin means and are accepted for the same reason.
#
# A channel's ONLY job is to turn whatever it received into those keyed lines
# and pipe them here. It must never map keys to tasks, build decision records,
# choose a close mode beyond what its card declared, or close anything itself.
#
# `bind`, `unbind`, and `binding` record that a captured-answer SOURCE feeds
# this intake, for any channel whose answers arrive detached from their origin
# (a process-event source id, for example). The binding is a private record
# under `state/decision-bindings/`; a source with no binding feeds nothing, so
# this whole path is opt-in per source and an unbound source behaves as if it
# did not exist. `bind` deliberately does not require the source to exist yet,
# so a channel can be bound BEFORE it is armed. The optional second argument
# exists only for legacy pre-collapse records and callers: a concrete origin is
# stored verbatim and used as the composition fallback above, and
# `--any-origin` stores the same `(any)` marker a plain `bind <source-id>`
# stores. `binding` prints the stored value verbatim and `answers` accepts it,
# so the process-event runner's feed seam is unchanged.
#
# `complete` is the shared investigation and visual-review completion gate.
# It attests, in the origin task's metadata, the reviewed inventory of
# captain-held tasks that carry the origin's unresolved captain calls.
# `--none` is an explicit semantic attestation that the just-reviewed surface
# has no unresolved captain call, and is refused while the origin still has an
# open keyed status decision. With a non-empty inventory, every listed task is
# verified durable (actively captain-held, or closed with a recorded answer),
# the inventory is unioned idempotently into the metadata, and every still-open
# keyed status decision is transferred to its durable owner with a
# `captain-held [key=...]` status close naming the inventory. Later review
# passes may add ids. A post-teardown visual review can complete against the
# surviving report and tasks without recreating task state.
# `verify` is read-only and is called by scout teardown, so teardown cannot
# erase a source before this gate has succeeded: every recorded inventory
# entry must still be durable and no keyed status decision may be open.
# Metadata compatibility: the attestation keeps the historical
# `decisions_reviewed=1` and `decision_keys=` keys, and an inventory entry that
# names no existing task resolves through the legacy `<origin>-decision-<entry>`
# identity, so pre-collapse metadata written by fm-decision-hold.sh verifies
# unchanged. An entry that exists as a task id is always that task.
#
# `open` is the read-only predicate a mechanical closer asks before it may
# retire a task's row: is this task still an open captain call? Exit 0 means it
# is (not Done, hold kind captain), 1 means it is not, and 2 means the answer
# could not be established, so a caller that must never close a live call can
# treat "cannot tell" as its own case instead of as a no. It prints nothing on
# 0 or 1 and mutates nothing. bin/fm-teardown.sh asks it before its automatic
# backlog close and, on 0, returns the row to Queued with its deliverable
# recorded instead (bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh owns that transition), so
# holding the very work item a question gates is safe; `answer` remains the
# only act that closes a captain call.
#
# `diverged` is the read-only guard over the seam between the two records of
# one captain call. See "record divergence" beside command_diverged below.
#
# Resolution records: the block written into the body names this script, the
# decision digest, and a `Resolution mode:` of answered, released, or repaired.
# Records written by the retired fm-decision-hold.sh (routed, declined,
# answered, repaired) are recognized everywhere a record is read, so nothing
# already closed needs rewriting.
#
# Parent channel: inside a secondmate home a task held for the captain, and its
# answer, are captain-facing facts the moment they are recorded, so `hold`
# publishes `needs-decision [key=captain-hold-<task>-<n>]` and `answer` (and
# `answers`) the matching `resolved` line on the parent channel through
# bin/fm-parent-channel-lib.sh, whether or not the mate model appends anything.
# <n> is the count of resolution records the body already carries plus one, so
# a released and re-held task opens and closes a distinct parent decision with
# no new persisted state, and an exact retry republishes the same line, which
# the channel deduplicates. A main home has no channel and publishes nothing.
# The hold or answer is already durable in the backlog, so a channel that
# cannot be written is reported as `actionable:` on stderr rather than undoing
# the record; bin/fm-inactive-reconcile.sh's diagnostics name a broken binding.

# --- record divergence ------------------------------------------------------
#
# A captain call can be written down twice, and until now nothing said when
# those two records disagreed. A `resolved [key=...]` line closes the status-log
# fold outright; the structured captain-held task is closed by a SEPARATE act
# (`answer` above). Closing only on the status side therefore looks complete
# there while the durable record still says the captain owes an answer and
# keeps resurfacing it. The defect was never the separation; it was the silence.
#
# `diverged` is a read-only report of that contradiction and nothing else. It
# closes NOTHING. A captain call closed wrongly disappears without review, which
# is strictly worse than the noise this prints, so reconciling a divergence stays
# a human-owned act - and it runs in either direction: record what the captain
# actually said with `answer`, or re-open the status decision when that
# resolution was not the captain's word.
#
# What it flags, and only this: a task that is still open and still carries the
# captain-hold annotations, whose key was closed on the status side by the
# RESOLVE verb. The other closing verb is not a divergence: a `captain-held`
# close is the VERIFIED transfer to that very task, written by command_complete
# only after verifying it, so the structured row staying open behind it is the
# correct state. Neither is a still-open status decision - the OPEN DECISIONS
# fold already owns that one.
#
# Routed work is deliberately irrelevant. When the decision IS the deliverable
# there is nothing to route, so the test is only whether the status side already
# declared this task's key resolved.
# Nor does the report interpret why that resolution exists. A call can turn out
# not to be a captain arbitration at all - a premise can dissolve, or a question
# of fact can prove its first reading wrong - so the report says only that the
# two records disagree and names both reconciliation directions above.
#
# Cost stays flat on a healthy home: one `tasks-axi list`, one key scan per
# status log, and the precise per-key fold only for a key that already names a
# still-open task. If tasks-axi is unavailable or its listing cannot be parsed,
# the guard cannot read the structured record and prints nothing.
#
# Output: one `<task-id>\t<origin>\t<key>\t<title>` line per divergence, in
# status-log then key order; nothing when the two records agree.

# Every still-open task id in this home's backlog, one per line. Only the first
# two comma-separated listing fields are read - both are slugs that precede any
# quoted title - so a title containing commas or quotes cannot shift them.
