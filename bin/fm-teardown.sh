# because treehouse return hard-resets the worktree and kills its processes.
# Scout tasks (kind=scout in meta) carve out of that check: their worktree is
# declared scratch and the report at data/<task-id>/report.md is the work
# product - teardown proceeds once the report exists, and refuses without it.
# Usage: fm-teardown.sh <task-id> [--force]
#   --force skips the unpushed-work check. Only use it when the captain has
#   explicitly said to discard the work.
