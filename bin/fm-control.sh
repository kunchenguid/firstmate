# fm-control.sh - the CONTROL PLANE for a firstmate-owned agent: allowlisted
# lifecycle verbs addressed to an exact task id.
#
# Usage: fm-control.sh <task-id> interrupt
#        fm-control.sh <task-id> exit
#        fm-control.sh <task-id> stand-down
#        fm-control.sh <task-id> repair-worker-state
#        fm-control.sh <task-id> relaunch [--harness <name>] [--model <name>]
#                                         [--effort <level>]
#                                         (--note <text> | --note-file <path>)
#
# Why this exists, and how it differs from fm-send.sh. bin/fm-send.sh is the
# DATA plane: conversational text for the agent to read, always routing-marked
# for a kind=secondmate target so the reply returns through the status path.
# That marking is right for a message and wrong for a lifecycle command - a
# marked "/quit" arrives as ordinary chat the agent reasons ABOUT instead of
# executing. This script is the control plane: semantic process control with a
# closed verb list, per-harness mechanics owned by an executable adapter
# (bin/fm-control-lib.sh) rather than improvised in agent prose, and a verified
# postcondition for every action. There is deliberately NO arbitrary-text and
# NO generic raw-key entry point here; fm-send remains the only way to send an
# agent something to read.
#
#   interrupt  Deliver the harness's verified interrupt sequence. The agent
#              keeps running. Postcondition: delivery succeeded, the endpoint
#              still exists, and the agent is still alive where the backend can
#              classify that. Cancellation is confirmed only from an adapter-
#              owned acknowledgement and otherwise reported unconfirmed. Busy
#              state is never rewritten as proof of the action.
#   exit       Stop the agent, preserving its terminal endpoint, worktree, and
#              every uncommitted change. Interrupts first when the task reads
#              busy, then submits the harness's exit command. Postcondition:
#              the backend's recovery-grade classifier reports the agent gone.
#              Already-stopped is success (idempotent).
#   stand-down Stop the agent for a deliberately held ship or scout task, then
#              atomically record that the task has no worker on purpose. The
#              record is published only after `exit` proves the agent is gone,
#              so a live worker never loses stale or wedge detection. It is
#              cleared when `relaunch` starts a replacement in the preserved
#              endpoint and worktree, and restored if that relaunch aborts
#              before the replacement is published. An interrupted transition
#              remains `standing-down`, which stays under ordinary supervision.
#              Refused while this task owns an in-flight no-mistakes run: that
#              run owns the branch and needs a worker at its gates, and
#              stand-down never cancels one for you. Refused too when that
#              question cannot be answered at all, naming the check that could
#              not answer, because the record it would publish suppresses
#              supervision. Refused as well while an unacknowledged steering
#              instruction is still waiting in the task's inbox, naming it: the
#              hold would silence its re-ring ladder, so the worker handles it
#              or the operator withdraws it first. An agent that already
#              exited can be declared intentional only when the task's status
#              log already declares the hold (`paused:`/`captain-held:`), since
#              deadness alone is the ambiguity this record exists to resolve.
#   repair-worker-state
#              Reconcile a worker-state record against the endpoint's observed
#              reality, idempotently and without hand-editing. Reality wins,
#              and only toward supervision: an unprovable record, or a
#              declaration a live agent contradicts, is cleared and the
#              discrepancy is reported. A dead endpoint alone never declares
#              intent, so repair can never create a suppression.
#   relaunch   Transactionally replace the running agent with a new one, in the
#              SAME endpoint and SAME worktree, on the same or a newly chosen
#              harness/model/effort - so switching harness is one ordinary use
#              of this verb. With no explicit axis, a secondmate re-resolves its
#              durable config/secondmate-harness pin (harness plus its optional
#              model and effort tokens) exactly as any other respawn does, while
#              a ship or scout keeps the exact adapter already recorded for it.
#              A prefixed raw-command basename cannot reconstruct its launch
#              command, so relaunch requires an explicit --harness for it.
#              --note is required for a ship or scout, whose replacement
#              inherits the local copy but none of the conversation; a
#              secondmate reconciles its own home's records at startup, so its
#              standing charter is never rewritten.
#              Records a durable checkpoint and that note, exits the old agent,
#              then delegates the launch to its single owner,
#              bin/fm-spawn.sh --relaunch. A failure before publication keeps
#              the prior durable record in place and reports the concrete
#              state; it never leaves a half-transitioned task claiming to be
#              running.
#
# Teardown and discard are NOT verbs here and never will be. `exit` stops an
# agent and preserves everything else; removing a worktree, killing an
# endpoint, or discarding work stays with bin/fm-teardown.sh, which owns the
# landed-work test.
#
# `resume` is not a verb: it is not deterministic across the verified adapters
# (bin/fm-control-lib.sh's header owns that reasoning). `relaunch` covers the
# same need for every adapter because the brief on disk, not a harness-private
# session, is the durable instruction.
#
# Targeting is EXACT: only a bare task id with a state/<id>.meta record in
# THIS home is accepted, and the record must pass the shared endpoint-identity
# validation (bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_validate_task_endpoint). A legacy
# fm-<id> label, an explicit session:window endpoint, and a bare window name
# are all refused - a lifecycle command delivered to the wrong endpoint is far
# worse than a loud refusal.
#
# A remotely placed secondmate is refused by name: its agent runs on another
# host, so no postcondition this plane verifies could be read for it here.
#
# Fail-closed boundaries:
#   - An unverified harness, or a harness whose control mechanics are unknown,
#     is refused rather than guessed at.
#   - A backend that cannot deliver the harness's interrupt key is refused
#     (Orca's terminal API has no Escape).
#   - `exit` and `relaunch` require a backend with a recovery-grade agent-state
#     classifier (tmux or herdr). The worker-state verbs stand-down and
#     repair-worker-state are supported only on tmux. zellij, orca, and cmux
#     are refused rather than reported as successful blind.
#   - An ambiguous or unreadable endpoint state refuses; only a positively
#     classified state acts.
#
# Environment knobs (all bounded waits, seconds):
#   FM_CONTROL_POLL              poll interval for postcondition waits (0.5)
#   FM_CONTROL_SETTLE_WAIT       adapter acknowledgement wait after interrupt (5)
#   FM_CONTROL_EXIT_WAIT         alive->dead wait after the exit command (30)
#   FM_CONTROL_LAUNCH_WAIT       dead->alive wait after a relaunch (90)
#   FM_CONTROL_EXIT_RETRIES      Enter retries for the exit command (3)

# healthy.
#
# Three preconditions keep the declaration honest rather than inferred:
#   - No in-flight no-mistakes run may be attributed to this task. An active
#     run owns the branch and needs a worker to answer its gates, so a hold is
#     not the operator's to declare yet. Stand-down never cancels a run: the
#     operator finishes it or aborts it explicitly first.
#   - An agent that is ALREADY gone can be declared intentional only when the
#     task's own authoritative hold declaration says so (the status log's
#     paused/captain-held verb, the same declaration both supervisors already
#     honour, per bin/fm-classify-lib.sh). Deadness alone is exactly the
#     ambiguity this record exists to resolve, so it never proves intent, and
#     the hold is reversible by the ordinary next status append.
#   - No unacknowledged steering instruction may be waiting for this worker.
#     The hold stops the watcher's re-ring ladder for the task, so a message
#     nobody has read yet must first be handled or explicitly withdrawn.
