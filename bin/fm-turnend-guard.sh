# Turn-end guard for any firstmate PRIMARY session: the main home OR a
# secondmate's own home. A secondmate runs its own primary firstmate session and
# is guarded exactly like the main primary; only child crew/scout worktrees are
# exempt (see the scoping block below and docs/turnend-guard.md).
#
# fm-guard.sh (bin/fm-guard.sh) is pull-based: it only warns when some other
# supervision script happens to run. A primary session that ends a turn without
# resuming its harness supervision protocol, and then never runs another
# fleet-touching command itself, can sit blind for hours.
# This script is push-based: verified harness turn-end hooks invoke it every time
# the primary is about to end a turn.
# Claude and codex can block directly by preserving exit status 2 and stderr.
# OpenCode, pi, and grok adapters use the same predicate and force one bounded
# follow-up because their turn-end events are passive.
# See docs/turnend-guard.md for the per-harness mechanics, validation evidence,
# and fail-open tradeoffs.
#
# Ships with TRACKED harness hook files at the repo root, so this file is
# checked out into every worktree of this repo: the primary checkout, every
# secondmate home (treehouse-leased or git-cloned), and any crewmate/scout task
# worktree spawned to work on firstmate itself (the recursive "firstmate
# improving itself" case). A secondmate home runs its OWN primary firstmate
# session, so it must be guarded like the main primary; only child crew/scout
# worktrees are exempt. It must therefore scope itself at runtime to a real
# primary checkout - the main home or a genuinely marked secondmate home - and
# stay a silent, fast no-op inside child task worktrees.
#
# Loop-guard: never block twice in the same turn. Claude Code and codex Stop
# payloads carry stop_hook_active=true when the CURRENT stop attempt was itself
# already forced by an earlier block this turn; on that signal we always allow
# the stop, whether or not watcher supervision actually got resumed. Passive
# harness adapters provide their own one-follow-up guard before calling this
# script.
# That bounds this to at most one forced continuation per turn - never a wedged,
# un-endable session - while still nagging again on a later turn if the problem
# persists.

# --- scope precisely to a PRIMARY checkout ----------------------------------
# A genuinely-marked secondmate home runs its OWN primary firstmate session, so
# force-INCLUDE it as a guarded primary whether treehouse leased it as a linked
# worktree (git-dir != git-common-dir) or it is a git-cloned plain checkout. This
# mirrors the cd-guard's intent that a secondmate's own session is a guarded
# primary. Only an UNMARKED checkout (or one with an invalid marker) falls
# through to the linked-worktree exemption: firstmate hands out crewmate/scout
# task worktrees as genuine linked `git worktree`s (bin/fm-spawn.sh aborts
# otherwise), whose git-dir lives under the parent repo's .git/worktrees/<name>
# and differs from the common (shared) git-dir, while a main, non-worktree
# checkout has the two equal. Child worktrees never carry the gitignored marker,
# so this exempts them while guarding every real secondmate home.
