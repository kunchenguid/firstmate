# Acquire or inspect the per-home firstmate session lock.
#
# Line 1 of state/.lock is the owning session's anchor pid, resolved by
# fm_session_lock_anchor_pid in bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh: the harness (agent)
# process found by walking the shell's ancestry, which lives as long as the
# firstmate session - unlike the transient subshell PID of any one tool call,
# which is dead moments after it is written. For a Claude session that proves a
# trusted session id the anchor is CLAUDE_PID, the model-loop process, so a
# shared transient daemon or a front-end that outlives the session never keeps
# a dead session's lock alive. Line 1 keeps its whole-line pid format because
# every other reader takes the first line as the pid.
#
# The identity behind that anchor is recorded beside the lock in
# state/.lock-session, a sidecar written only here and only under the claim lock:
# line 1 the session id, line 2 the harness that published it, line 3 the
# anchor's own start time. Refreshed on every confirmed-own acquisition,
# including the early already-mine exit that waits for the claim lock, removed
# when the acquiring session proves no trusted id, and left byte-identical when
# it already names that id, harness, and process identity. A same-session
# confirmation never rewrites line 1 while the recorded pid is alive, because
# bin/fm-startup-network.sh compares that pid across its deferred sweeps, so the
# sidecar's process identity follows the pid that line 1 still carries, not this
# session's own candidate; a dead recorded pid is reclaimed and rewritten to
# this session's anchor.
#
# Usage: fm-lock.sh           acquire; exit 1 unless ownership is verified
#        fm-lock.sh status    print holder and liveness; always exits 0.
#                             A held lock is not proof the holder is consuming
#                             wakes. Machine-readable lock fields live on
#                             fm-inbox.sh ready, from the same inspect helper.
