# What this file adds is the one thing the lock deliberately does not say: which
# pid of that ancestry is the session actually WORKING in this home. Nothing can
# recover that from outside the session - a pane rendering the running-session
# overview is a child of the terminal, not of any harness, so it has no ancestry
# to walk - and without it such a reader can only report every session as
# unattributable and withhold every close command it might otherwise offer.
# Recorded here because this is where the ancestry is already known; a reader
# that finds no sidecar falls back to exactly that safe behaviour.
