# Lavish adapter for the generic process-to-event runner.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh arm [--cross-home] <artifact.html>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh classify <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh terminal <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh source-id <artifact.html>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh retire <artifact.html>
#
# arm        Register this artifact's poll as a source of THIS home. The home
#            whose tree contains the artifact is its default owner, so arming an
#            artifact outside $FM_HOME refuses; --cross-home is the explicit,
#            self-describing override for an artifact deliberately shared with
#            another home, and it prints what it overrode. Transferring an
#            existing review means retiring it in the old home first and then
#            arming it in the new owner home; two homes registering one artifact
#            leaves the loser inert behind the winner's machine-wide claim.
# classify   Print the lifecycle state a handler should act on: feedback, ended,
#            waiting, missing, or unknown.
# terminal   Exit 0 when the captured result means this Lavish source will never
#            produce another result, so the runner may retire it; any other exit
#            keeps it armed. This is the generic adapter contract bin/fm-procevent.sh
#            calls, and the only place Lavish's notion of "ended" is decided.
#
# This adapter is deliberately thin. It owns only what is specific to Lavish:
# canonical source identity, the argv for the currently published poll command,
# and how to read a completed result. Ownership, durable capture, publication,
# and restart recovery all belong to bin/fm-procevent.sh.
#
# It wraps ONLY the currently published interface, verified against 0.1.45:
#   Usage: lavish-axi poll <html-file> [--agent-reply "..."]
# and that command "long-polls indefinitely" server-side. The adapter therefore
# runs the plain blocking form with no timeout flag, so results arrive as real
# server-side events. It adds no periodic discovery, no timer fallback, and no
# dependency on any unreleased capability.
#
# LOSS LIMITATION, stated plainly. The published poll destructively clears
# feedback before returning it. A result lost after that clearing and before the
# runner reads the process output is unrecoverable, and no Firstmate wrapper can
# close that source-side handoff window. Never describe this path as
# at-least-once, no-loss, or lossless. The only durability this proves is the
# runner's own: output that reached the runner is stored before it is announced.
