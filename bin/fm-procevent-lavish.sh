# Lavish adapter for the generic process-to-event runner.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh arm <artifact.html>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh classify <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh terminal <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh source-id <artifact.html>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh retire <artifact.html>
#
# arm        Register the canonical source, reconcile it through the generic
#            runner, and report armed only after that exact source has held live
#            ownership for the runner's whole settle window. That window is what
#            makes the verdict about the review session and not merely about the
#            listener process: the published poll takes a moment to answer, so a
#            confirmation that ended when the process appeared would report a
#            handoff ready and only then learn the session was already gone.
#            A failed confirmation returns nonzero and stays registered for the
#            runner's ordinary restart recovery. A target session that has
#            already ended or is missing is a hard failure too, reported as
#            exactly that: it cannot accept feedback, so it never becomes live,
#            and re-arming it only polls an ended session again. Its terminal
#            result is still captured, announced, and handled normally.
# classify   Print the lifecycle state a handler should act on: feedback, ended,
#            waiting, missing, or unknown.
# terminal   Exit 0 when the captured result means this Lavish source will never
#            produce another result, so the runner may retire it; any other exit
#            keeps it armed. This is the generic adapter contract bin/fm-procevent.sh
#            calls, and the only place Lavish's notion of "ended" is decided.
#
# This adapter is deliberately thin. It owns only what is specific to Lavish:
# canonical source identity, the argv for the currently published poll command,
# and how to read a completed result. Ownership, durable capture, publication,
# and restart recovery all belong to bin/fm-procevent.sh.
#
# It wraps ONLY the currently published interface, verified against 0.1.45:
#   Usage: lavish-axi poll <html-file> [--agent-reply "..."]
# and that command "long-polls indefinitely" server-side. The adapter therefore
# runs the plain blocking form with no timeout flag, so results arrive as real
# server-side events. It adds no periodic discovery, no timer fallback, and no
# dependency on any unreleased capability.
#
# LOSS LIMITATION, stated plainly. The published poll destructively clears
# feedback before returning it. A result lost after that clearing and before the
# runner reads the process output is unrecoverable, and no Firstmate wrapper can
# close that source-side handoff window. Never describe this path as
# at-least-once, no-loss, or lossless. The only durability this proves is the
# runner's own: output that reached the runner is stored before it is announced.
