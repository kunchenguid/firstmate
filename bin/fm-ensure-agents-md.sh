# Ensure a project worktree follows the agent-memory file convention.
# AGENTS.md is the real project-intrinsic knowledge file; CLAUDE.md is a
# relative symlink to it for compatibility. Creates a minimal AGENTS.md skeleton
# when neither file exists, promotes a real CLAUDE.md file when it is the only
# file present, and refuses to clobber distinct real files or wrong symlinks.
# Owns the canonical "## Maintaining this file" self-governance wording for
# project AGENTS.md files, injecting it idempotently into created skeletons,
# promoted CLAUDE.md files, and any existing AGENTS.md that still lacks it.
# Refuses a case-variant real memory file such as a lowercase agents.md, whose
# CLAUDE.md symlink would carry an uppercase literal target that dangles on a
# case-sensitive filesystem (issue #389).
# Refuses to promote CLAUDE.md when the repo's own tracked automation guards
# it by literal path (a --disallowedTools entry naming CLAUDE.md) - promoting
# would move the real content to AGENTS.md while that guard keeps matching
# only the now-empty CLAUDE.md symlink, silently defeating the protection.
# This is a narrow textual heuristic for that one known shape, not general
# detection of every possible guard mechanism; a guard built from a variable,
# a separate config file, or a non-CLI enforcement path can still slip through.
# This is a worktree utility for crewmates, not a supervision script, so it does
# not call fm-guard.sh.
