# ONE owner for the no-mistakes run-attribution primitives used by
# fm-crew-state.sh (read-only current-state reporting) and fm-teardown.sh
# (pre-teardown run abort, see its "Fix 1" header comment). Both bind a run
# by strict branch-and-head identity first, and both then recognize a provable
# pipeline-owned continuation through fm_nm_runs_status_for_worktree below:
# crew-state for an ACTIVE run, so a fix round never reads as an older failed
# run, and teardown for a run PARKED at a gate, so cleanup concludes it
# instead of orphaning it. Getting this wrong in either
# direction is unsafe: a false negative hides a genuinely parked run, and a
# false positive lets teardown act on a run it does not own.

# Bounded call to `no-mistakes "$@"` in dir $1, timeout $2 seconds. The bounded

# runs-listing subcommand - verified against the installed CLI). Prints the
# status word of the branch's CURRENT run row, or nothing when the ledger
# cannot prove attribution. When optional expected head $4 is supplied, its
# abbreviated commit identity must match the newest row. The branch's NEWEST
# row alone decides; older rows are history and never answer for the present:
#   - newest row's head resolves and matches the worktree (fm_nm_head_matches_worktree):
#     its status word
#   - newest row's head resolves but does not match: nothing (a newer run that
#     is not this worktree's makes every older row stale history)

#     its fix round in its own checkout and the task copy never fetched it):
#     recognized ONLY as a provable pipeline-owned continuation of the
#     submitted head, which requires ALL of: the row is ACTIVE (status
#     running), and the immediately older row for the SAME branch resolves to
#     EXACTLY the worktree HEAD. The pipeline's own ledger then proves an
#     unbroken run sequence from a run that ended at the submitted head to an
#     active run on the same branch - the anchored active row's status word is
#     printed. Anything else (no anchor row, an anchor that is merely an
#     ancestor, a terminal unresolvable row) prints nothing, so branch-name
#     coincidence, arbitrary remote state, and other tasks' runs never match.
