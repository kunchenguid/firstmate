# bin/fm-backend-launch-env-lib.sh - the single owner of the color-control
# variables that must never ride into a long-lived session-provider server.
#
# The tmux, Herdr, and zellij adapters each birth a server or detached session
# that outlives the launch, and each one hands its own startup environment to
# every pane it later creates (docs/verification/runtime-backends.md, "a
# long-lived tmux or Herdr server hands panes the environment it was started
# with"). They are the whole list: orca refuses unless its runtime is already
# up, and cmux reaches its app through `open`, so neither backend ever births a
# session provider out of firstmate's own shell environment. A secondmate
# or agent that launches firstmate under NO_COLOR=1 therefore bleaches every
# later crew pane, and the leak does not self-heal: NO_COLOR is not in tmux's
# default `update-environment` set, so a later client attach does not repair it.
#
# The launcher's color preference describes the LAUNCHER's terminal, never the
# crew panes, so no backend wants it propagated. Each of those three adapters
# calls this in the subshell that starts its server; the list lives here once so
# tmux, Herdr, and zellij cannot drift apart.
#
# Scope: color control only. Firstmate home/directory overrides and harness
# identity markers are scrubbed per-backend, because which of those a given
# server may keep is a backend-specific, empirically verified decision.

# fm_backend_launch_env_color_scrub: drop every color-suppression and
# color-forcing variable from the current (sub)shell, so the server about to be
# started inherits the terminal's own color behavior instead of the launcher's.
