# fm-tmux-lib.sh — shared tmux pane primitives for firstmate.
#
# ONE tmux source for delivery-busy detection, composer capture primitives,
# and verified submit.
# Both the away-mode daemon and bin/fm-send.sh reach these primitives through
# backend dispatch, while bin/fm-composer-lib.sh owns the shared verdict.
#
# Composer shapes and verdicts are owned by bin/fm-composer-lib.sh.
# This file owns only tmux's styled capture, cursor and identity primitives,
# delivery busy read, and submit conversions that consume the shared verdict.
# Styled captures remain internal; fm-peek and every human-facing capture stay
# plain.
#
# OpenCode's busy-queued Enter conversion accepts only structurally proven
# pending text after retries, while the separate turn-started conversion accepts
# an unknown post-Enter composer only after this submit observed an idle baseline
# become busy.
# The queued-Enter policy itself lives in fm_composer_queued_enter_verdict
# (bin/fm-composer-lib.sh); this file supplies tmux's pane-busy primitive.
#
# FM_COMPOSER_IDLE_RE is interpreted by the shared classifier with its structural
# and styling safety gates.
# FM_BUSY_REGEX overrides the rendered delivery-busy matching used here.
#
# NOT a task-state source: task busy state is owned by bin/fm-busy-lib.sh's
# semantic contract. The matching below serves only delivery guards: the submit
# acknowledgement and the away-mode supervisor-pane busy guard. Both ask about
# the pane receiving input, not the state of a recorded worker task. Matching
# stays harness-scoped so one harness's output cannot make another read busy.
#
# All functions are `set -u` and `set -e` safe (guarded tmux calls, explicit
# returns) so they can be sourced into either context.
#
# Composer classification is NOT owned here: every shape, glyph, border
# family, geometry rule, and verdict decision lives in the shared
# bin/fm-composer-lib.sh (fm_composer_classify_screen), sourced below and
# reused by every backend adapter so the decision cannot drift. This file
# keeps only tmux's genuine capture-side primitives - the styled pane
# capture, the #{cursor_y} cursor read, the Pi/Copilot foreground-process identity
# probe, and the capability descriptor - plus the busy detection and submit
# cores that consume the shared verdict.

# fm_tmux_strip_ghost: thin adapter over the shared, fleet-wide ghost extractor
# fm_composer_strip_ghost (bin/fm-composer-lib.sh). It drops de-emphasised
# ghost/placeholder runs - dim/faint (SGR 2, claude's/codex's/cursor's ghost) AND a
# dark/muted truecolor foreground (grok's placeholder) - from one captured,
# styled composer line and prints the plain, real-typed text. Kept as a named
# tmux entry point (and for existing callers/tests) but owns no logic of its own,
# so the tmux and herdr adapters cannot drift apart on what counts as ghost text.

# --- tmux composer capture and capability primitives ------------------------
#
# These four functions are the ONLY tmux-specific composer knowledge left:
# how to capture a styled screen, how to read the cursor row, how to probe a
# live pi agent, and the static capability facts. Every shape, glyph, border
# family, and verdict decision lives in the shared owner
# (bin/fm-composer-lib.sh, fm_composer_classify_screen), so a new harness
# shape is taught there once and never here.

# fm_tmux_composer_capture: the visible pane WITH ANSI styling. The styled
# capture is consumed internally by the classifier and is NEVER surfaced
# (fm-peek and every human/LLM-facing path stay plain).

# fm_tmux_composer_identity: the tmux agent-identity probe backing the
# separated Pi and half-box Copilot composer shapes, tmux's analogue of herdr's native
# `agent get`. It answers for Pi and Copilot from live foreground identity:
#   - identity: the pane tty's FOREGROUND process group (pgid = tpgid, the
#     same scoping as fm_backend_tmux_foreground_comms) contains a pi-family
#     process (pi, pi-signed, pi-launcher - docs/verification/
#     runtime-backends.md "Agent liveness name sources"), falling back to
#     tmux's own foreground-derived #{pane_current_command}. A pane whose
#     agent died to a shell has no pi foreground process and gets NO identity,
#     which is exactly what keeps the strict blank-row rule honest: a blank
#     row between two stale rules stays unknown.
#   - status: Pi's verified busy footer via fm_pane_is_busy, mapped onto the
#     idle/working vocabulary herdr's probe reports natively.
# Copilot needs only a live identity because the complete half-box proves its
# composer boundary.
# Prints "pi<TAB>idle", "pi<TAB>working", or "copilot<TAB>present"; exits 1
# when neither live identity is present.

# it. Echoes the final proof-carrying verdict on stdout so callers can require
# exact `empty` before treating submission as confirmed.
# Busy-queued Enter (opencode 1.18.4): the harness accepts Enter while mid-turn
# and queues it for after the current turn, but keeps the typed text visible in
# the composer. Once the Enter-retry budget is spent and a structurally proven
# composer still reads "pending", the submit core falls back to
# `fm_pane_is_busy`: a busy pane means the Enter was accepted and queued (report
# `empty` so the caller does not re-send), while an idle pane keeps `pending` as
# a genuine swallow. Pending-unproven receives the same Enter retry budget but
# never reaches this exception.
# Turn-started confirmation (the strict blank-row posture's counterpart): a
# harness whose mid-turn screen the classifier cannot positively identify (pi
# replaces its separated composer while working) reads `unknown` right after a
# successful submit. When and only when the pane was IDLE before the text was
# typed, an idle-to-busy transition across our Enter is proof the harness
# accepted the submission - the same semantic signal herdr's native
# agent-state confirmation uses, read from the pane's verified busy footer.
# The busy read is polled across the remaining retry budget because the turn
# takes a beat to render. Without the baseline (a direct
# fm_tmux_submit_enter_core caller, or a pane already busy before typing) an
# `unknown` verdict is preserved untouched: busy conversion without the
