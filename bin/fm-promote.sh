# state/<task-id>.meta so fm-teardown.sh applies the full unpushed-work protection
# again. After promoting, send the crewmate its ship instructions via fm-send.sh
# (inventory scratch state, reset to a clean default-branch base, carry over only
# intended fix changes, create branch fm/<task-id>, implement, report done, then
# /no-mistakes).
