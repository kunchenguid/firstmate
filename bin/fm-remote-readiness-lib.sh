# fm-remote-readiness-lib.sh - the remote second-mate readiness gate sequence.
#
# Source this file and call:
#   fm_remote_readiness_ensure <bin-dir> <secondmate-id>
#
# It runs bin/fm-remote-doctor.sh on that route's configured host, and when the
# read-only run reports any gap it runs the doctor again with --fix and then a
# third read-only time. That last read-only run is the verdict, so a repair is
# never trusted on its own word. bin/fm-remote-doctor.sh remains the single
# owner of every check, every repair, and every message; nothing here restates
# them.
#
# Returns 0 when the host is ready, 1 when a gap remains, and 255 when SSH could
# not complete. 255 means unknown remote completion, so a caller preserves its
# route and reconciles on the same host instead of treating it as a refusal.
# FM_REMOTE_READINESS_OUT always holds the output of the last run, which carries
# the check lines, the remaining human: gaps, and their exact operator actions.

# Consumed by the sourcing caller, so every assignment reads as unused here.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
