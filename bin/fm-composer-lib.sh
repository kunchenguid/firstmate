# bin/fm-composer-lib.sh - the ONE fleet-wide owner of composer-content
# classification, shared by every session-provider adapter: the tmux path
# through bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh, and bin/backends/{herdr,orca,cmux}.sh directly.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (task fm-composer-shellglyph-safety): the four adapters each
# carried their own copy of the "is this composer row empty / pending / not an
# agent composer" decision, and the copies drifted. The dangerous drift: a BARE
# shell prompt glyph (`>`, `$`, `%`, `#`) - what a pane shows once its agent has
# exited to a plain login shell - was treated as an empty, ready-to-inject
# AGENT composer. The away-mode escalation injector (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh)
# reads composer-emptiness to decide whether a pane is a safe injection target,
# so a dead-shell pane misread as "empty" meant an escalation could be typed
# into (and, worst case, executed by) that shell. Consolidating the one decision
# here means the safety rule cannot silently drift across adapters again.
#
# THE SAFETY RULE this owner enforces: a bare shell prompt glyph is a genuine
# empty agent composer ONLY when it appears INSIDE a real agent-composer
# container - a bordered composer box, where the harness draws its own prompt
# glyph (e.g. claude's older `| > ... |`). On a bare, unstructured row it is a
# dead-shell prompt and is NEVER "empty"; it classifies as `unknown` (not a safe
# injection target). The AGENT prompt glyphs `❯` (claude) and `›` (codex) are a
# genuine empty agent composer either way, bordered or bare.
#
# GHOST/PLACEHOLDER TEXT is the other half of this owner (task
# afk-herdr-false-pending): a harness fills an otherwise-empty composer with
# de-emphasized ghost text - claude's rotating prompt suggestion, codex's idle
# suggestion, grok's placeholder - which a plain capture cannot tell apart from
# text a human typed, so the away-mode injector reads the idle pane as "pending
# input" and defers every escalation (the overnight wedge that motivated this
# consolidation). fm_composer_strip_ghost is the ONE ANSI-aware extractor of
# "real typed content": it drops every de-emphasized run - dim/faint (SGR 2, how
# claude and codex render ghost text) AND a dark/muted TRUECOLOR foreground (how
# grok renders placeholder/hint text) - and keeps only normal-intensity,
# normally-coloured text. Consolidating it here means the two ANSI-capable
# adapters (tmux via bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh, herdr via bin/backends/herdr.sh) cannot
# drift into per-harness one-off strips again; the previous herdr-only faint
# byte-pattern check missed claude's own dim ghost (its prompt glyph is not
# bold-wrapped) and no adapter covered grok's truecolor placeholder at all.
#
# Each adapter still owns its own CAPTURE and structural row-finding, because
# those use genuinely different primitives (tmux's cursor-row read, herdr's ANSI
# tail scan, orca/cmux's plain read-screen). Once an adapter has a candidate
# composer row it hands the RAW styled row to fm_composer_strip_ghost for the
# real-typed-content extraction, strips the box borders, trims, and hands the
# result plus a <bordered> flag to fm_composer_classify_content for the shared
# empty|pending|unknown verdict. orca/cmux read a plain (unstyled) screen so
# they have no ghost styling to strip and rely on the idle-placeholder match
# below. Re-sourcing is a cheap idempotent redefinition, so this file needs no
# include guard (matching bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh).

# fm_composer_strip_ansi: drop every CSI escape sequence, leaving plain text.
# Used for STRUCTURAL row/shape detection, where ghost text must be KEPT so the
# composer box border or bare prompt glyph is still visible; content extraction
# uses fm_composer_strip_ghost instead. Reads the styled text on stdin and prints
# plain text (stdin-only, matching fm_composer_strip_ghost). The character class
# includes ':' so an ITU colon-form SGR (38:2::r:g:b) is stripped whole, not left
# with a dangling tail.

# fm_composer_strip_ghost: the ONE fleet-wide ANSI-aware extractor of "real typed
# content" from a captured, styled composer row. Reads the styled line on stdin
# (from `tmux capture-pane -e` or `herdr pane read --format ansi`) and prints the
# plain, non-ghost text on stdout, dropping:
#   - dim/faint runs (SGR 2): how claude and codex render ghost/suggestion text.
#     A reset (SGR 0) or normal-intensity (SGR 22) ends a dim run.
#   - dark/muted TRUECOLOR foreground runs (SGR 38;2;r;g;b or the colon form
#     38:2::r:g:b) whose perceived luminance (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B) is below
#     FM_COMPOSER_GHOST_LUMA_MAX (default 128): how grok renders its placeholder
#     and hint text. A reset (SGR 0), a default-foreground (SGR 39), any base
#     foreground colour (30-37 / 90-97), or a lighter 38;2 foreground ends the
#     dark-foreground run. This assumes a DARK terminal theme, the firstmate
#     fleet reality, where real typed input is bright and only de-emphasised UI
#     is dark; the SGR-2 signal above stays theme-independent. A 256-colour
#     foreground (38;5;n) is NOT luminance-tested - it is palette-dependent and
#     no fleet harness uses it for ghost text, so it is kept (real text wins:
#     under-stripping merely defers, which the max-defer alarm surfaces, while
#     over-stripping would inject over real input).
# The dim/faint and dark-foreground states are tracked together as "de-emphasis";
# codes are processed left to right within a sequence, so "ESC[0;2m" reads as dim.
# LC_ALL=C makes awk walk bytes, so multibyte glyphs (e.g. ❯) and de-emphasised
# runs alike pass through or drop intact without locale-dependent classes.
