# Single owner of a ship task's mode-specific "Definition of done" block.
# Sourced by bin/fm-brief.sh, which renders it into a generated ship brief, and by
# bin/fm-promote.sh, which renders it into the ship instructions a promoted scout
# receives. Both paths must hand the worker the same contract: a promoted
# no-mistakes worker that never received the ask-user escalation rule or the
# `--yes` ban is the exact delivery hole this single owner exists to close.
# fm_dod_block <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> <task-id> prints the block on
# stdout with no trailing blank line. The caller validates the mode; an unknown
# mode is refused rather than silently rendered as the pipeline contract.
# The block opens with the fixed machine-readable "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>"
# line that bin/fm-spawn.sh checks a ship brief against.
# This file is the one owner of the no-mistakes `--intent` contract: only the
# brief's `## Captain's intent` subsection plus later captain words, never
# `## Firstmate spec` and never the worker's own tradeoffs. bin/fm-brief.sh
# scaffolds those two `# Task` subsections; bin/fm-spawn.sh and bin/fm-promote.sh
# refuse leftover `{TASK}` / `{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}` placeholders through the helpers
# below. Other mentions of `--intent` point here rather than restating the rule.
# Every heredoc here stays outside a command substitution: `VAR=$(cat <<EOF ...)`
# breaks parsing of the whole file on Bash 3.2 (tests/fm-brief.test.sh).

# placeholder. A missing file and legacy briefs carry no such placeholders.

# Definition of done
Delivery contract: mode=direct-PR
This task ships **direct-PR**: you raise the PR yourself, without the no-mistakes pipeline.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.
When it is implemented and committed, push your branch and open a PR with \`gh-axi\`, then append \`done: PR {url}\` to the status file and stop.
Do NOT run /no-mistakes. The configured merge authority decides whether to merge the PR; firstmate relays the outcome.

# Definition of done
Delivery contract: mode=local-only
This task ships **local-only**: no remote, no PR, no pipeline.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch \`fm/$id\`. Do NOT push, do NOT open a PR, do NOT merge.
Keep your branch a clean fast-forward onto the current default branch - if \`main\` has advanced, rebase onto it so the eventual merge stays a fast-forward.
When it is implemented and committed, append \`done: ready in branch fm/$id\` to the status file and stop.
The configured merge authority approves the ready branch, then firstmate merges it into local \`main\` through the guarded fast-forward path.

# Definition of done
Delivery contract: mode=no-mistakes
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.
When you believe it is complete, append \`done: {summary}\` to the status file and stop.
Firstmate will then instruct you to run /no-mistakes to validate and ship a PR.

You drive no-mistakes by responding to its gates, not by implementing fixes.
Follow the guidance no-mistakes itself provides for the mechanics: it loads when you invoke /no-mistakes, and \`no-mistakes axi run --help\` plus the \`help\` lines in each \`axi\` response are authoritative and version-matched to the installed binary.
When starting no-mistakes, pass \`--intent\` as only this brief's \`## Captain's intent\` subsection plus any later words the captain actually said.
Do not include \`## Firstmate spec\`, later Firstmate build constraints, or your own decisions and tradeoffs.
This replaces the no-mistakes skill's advice to enrich \`--intent\` with decisions and tradeoffs; that advice does not apply to Firstmate-dispatched work.
Do not hand-edit, commit, or fix findings yourself while a run is active - the pipeline applies every fix.

Two firstmate-specific rules layer on top of that guidance:
- ask-user findings are never yours to answer: escalate to firstmate (rule 6) and stop.
  Firstmate applies \`ask-user-authority\` and obtains any required captain decision.
  When the decision comes back, feed it to the gate with \`no-mistakes axi respond\` and let the pipeline apply it - do not route the question to "the user" or implement the fix yourself.
- NEVER pass \`--yes\` (or \`-y\`) to \`no-mistakes axi run\` or \`no-mistakes axi respond\`. It is banned fleet-wide.
  It auto-resolves every gate including ask-user findings with no escalation, and answering your own ask-user finding is a hard rule violation.

After /no-mistakes reports CI green (the CI-ready return point - do not wait for it to keep monitoring in the background until merge), append \`done: PR {url} checks green\` and stop. You are finished.
