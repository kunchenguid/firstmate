# Single owner of a ship task's mode-specific "Definition of done" block.
# Sourced by bin/fm-brief.sh, which renders it into a generated ship brief, and by
# bin/fm-promote.sh, which renders it into the ship instructions a promoted scout
# receives. Both paths must hand the worker the same contract: a promoted
# no-mistakes worker that never received the ask-user escalation rule or the
# `--yes` ban is the exact delivery hole this single owner exists to close.
# fm_dod_block <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> <task-id> [<existing-pr-url>] [<base-branch>]
# prints the block on stdout with no trailing blank line. The caller validates
# the mode and existing PR URL; an unknown mode is refused rather than silently
# rendered as the pipeline contract.
# The block opens with the fixed machine-readable "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>"
# line that bin/fm-spawn.sh checks a ship brief against.
# This file is the one owner of the no-mistakes `--intent` contract: only the
# brief's `## Captain's intent` subsection plus later captain words, never
# `## Firstmate spec` and never the worker's own tradeoffs.
# The string passed must be self-sufficient - it plus the codebase reconstructs
# roughly the same specification - so a report, decision, or PR the intent
# refers to is written into it as substance, never left as a pointer.
# bin/fm-brief.sh scaffolds those two `# Task` subsections; bin/fm-spawn.sh and
# bin/fm-promote.sh refuse leftover `{TASK}` / `{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}` placeholders
# through the helpers below. Other mentions of `--intent` point here rather than
# restating the rule.
# Every heredoc here stays outside a command substitution: `VAR=$(cat <<EOF ...)`
# breaks parsing of the whole file on Bash 3.2 (tests/fm-brief.test.sh).
# fm_brief_worker_role owns the ship/scout role scope. bin/fm-spawn.sh is its one
# emitter, supplying it to every ship/scout launch brief and never to a
# secondmate charter. Like fm_brief_intent_overlay it is a distinctly titled
# launch section that states its own precedence for Firstmate tasks, so a brief
# that authors its own role wording is superseded rather than duplicated.

When this task works on Firstmate itself, this section supersedes every earlier brief instruction about your role and identity.
When this task works on Firstmate itself, the repository root `AGENTS.md` (also imported by `CLAUDE.md`) is the primary/secondmate supervisor's contract: follow this brief instead of that supervisor contract.
For that Firstmate task, do the assigned work yourself and report to firstmate; do not adopt the supervisor identity, delegate the task, run fleet supervision, or address the captain.
This exception preserves this brief's safety and authority boundaries and applicable contributor guidance, including `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `firstmate-coding-guidelines` for Firstmate changes.
Other projects retain their own instructions unchanged.

You drive no-mistakes by responding to its gates, not by implementing fixes.
Follow the guidance no-mistakes itself provides for the mechanics: it loads when you invoke /no-mistakes, and \`no-mistakes axi run --help\` plus the \`help\` lines in each \`axi\` response are authoritative and version-matched to the installed binary.
When starting no-mistakes, pass \`--intent\` as only this brief's \`## Captain's intent\` subsection plus any later words the captain actually said.
For a legacy brief with no such subsection, include only words explicitly labeled \`Captain:\`, \`Captain's words:\`, \`Captain's ask:\`, or \`Captain's intent:\`; never copy its mixed \`# Task\` wholesale. If it has no provenance-marked captain words, stop and ask firstmate instead of starting no-mistakes.
Do not include \`## Firstmate spec\`, later Firstmate build constraints, or your own decisions and tradeoffs.
The \`--intent\` string you pass must be self-sufficient: that string plus the codebase must let a reader reconstruct roughly the same specification, without depending on a separate report, a PR, or context that lives only in this conversation.
When the captain's intent refers to a report, decision, or PR ("do items 1, 2, 3, and 7 of the report"), write the substance of the referenced items into \`--intent\` in the captain's terms, not only the pointer; that substance is the captain's ask by reference, while Firstmate's build instructions and your own decisions still stay out.
This replaces the no-mistakes skill's advice to enrich \`--intent\` with decisions and tradeoffs; that advice does not apply to Firstmate-dispatched work.
Do not hand-edit, commit, or fix findings yourself while a run is active - the pipeline applies every fix.

One drive call blocks until the next gate or outcome, which routinely outlives what your harness lets a single command run: Claude Code kills a command at ten minutes maximum, while one fix round is capped around thirty minutes and up to three rounds chain.
So background the drive call and poll \`no-mistakes axi status\` from a separate call instead of sitting in one blocking hold your harness will kill.
Where a harness's own command limit is not established, assume it bounds commands and use that same background-and-poll shape.
A killed or timed-out call is never evidence the daemon died: the daemon accepts your response immediately and runs the round in the background, so the call was only ever waiting for a read while the run kept working.
Reattach and keep going rather than reporting the pipeline blocked; rule 7 owns the checks that decide when a pipeline block is real.

Two firstmate-specific rules layer on top of that guidance:
- ask-user findings are never yours to answer: escalate to firstmate using rule 6's ask-user format and stop.
  Firstmate applies \`ask-user-authority\` and obtains any required captain decision.
  When the decision comes back, feed it to the gate with \`no-mistakes axi respond\` and let the pipeline apply it - do not route the question to "the user" or implement the fix yourself.
- NEVER pass \`--yes\` (or \`-y\`) to \`no-mistakes axi run\` or \`no-mistakes axi respond\`. It is banned fleet-wide.
  It auto-resolves every gate including ask-user findings with no escalation, and answering your own ask-user finding is a hard rule violation.
