# Single owner of a ship task's mode-specific "Definition of done" block.
# Shared by brief generation, scout promotion, and the launch overlay owned by
# bin/fm-spawn.sh. Every path must deliver the same contract so older briefs and
# promoted workers cannot miss current delivery or ask-user safety boundaries.
# fm_dod_block <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> <task-id> prints the block on
# stdout with no trailing blank line. The caller validates the mode; an unknown
# mode is refused rather than silently rendered as the pipeline contract.
# The block opens with the fixed machine-readable "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>"
# line that bin/fm-spawn.sh checks a ship brief against.
# This file is the one owner of the no-mistakes `--intent` contract: complete
# accepted product/engineering requirements, with captain/spec provenance kept
# distinct from private worker control and public PR copy.
# The string passed must be self-sufficient - it plus the codebase reconstructs
# roughly the same specification - so a report, decision, or PR the intent
# refers to is written into it as substance, never left as a pointer.
# bin/fm-brief.sh scaffolds those two `# Task` subsections; bin/fm-spawn.sh and
# bin/fm-promote.sh refuse leftover `{TASK}` / `{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}` placeholders
# through the helpers below. Other mentions of `--intent` point here rather than
# restating the rule.
# Every heredoc here stays outside a command substitution: `VAR=$(cat <<EOF ...)`
# breaks parsing of the whole file on Bash 3.2 (tests/fm-brief.test.sh).
# fm_brief_worker_role owns the ship/scout role scope. bin/fm-spawn.sh is its one
# emitter, supplying it to every ship/scout launch brief and never to a
# secondmate charter. Like fm_brief_intent_overlay it is a distinctly titled
# launch section that states its own precedence for Firstmate tasks, so a brief
# that authors its own role wording is superseded rather than duplicated.

When this task works on Firstmate itself, this section supersedes every earlier brief instruction about your role and identity.
When this task works on Firstmate itself, the repository root `AGENTS.md` (also imported by `CLAUDE.md`) is the primary/secondmate supervisor's contract: follow this brief instead of that supervisor contract.
For that Firstmate task, do the assigned work yourself and report to firstmate; do not adopt the supervisor identity, delegate the task, run fleet supervision, or address the captain.
This exception preserves this brief's safety and authority boundaries and applicable contributor guidance, including `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `firstmate-coding-guidelines` for Firstmate changes.
Other projects retain their own instructions unchanged.

When starting no-mistakes, preserve every accepted product/engineering requirement, constraint, exclusion, proof obligation, and later accepted decision in `--intent`, replacing superseded requirements with their current accepted form; never substitute a diff summary.
Use `## Captain's intent` and the accepted requirements in `## Firstmate spec` plus later accepted clarifications, without relabeling Firstmate specifications as captain words or treating your own unapproved tradeoffs as accepted requirements.
For a legacy mixed `# Task`, retain provenance-marked captain words and all accepted product/engineering requirements; if captain provenance is missing or acceptance is unclear, ask firstmate rather than inventing intent.
Keep private handoff destinations and worker-control instructions (status reporting, routing, and delivery mechanics) in the brief, not in review intent; offline-test, no-live-effect, access, and other product/engineering safety constraints remain acceptance criteria.
The `--intent` string must be self-sufficient: resolve referenced reports, decisions, and PRs into their accepted substance so that intent plus the codebase reconstructs the specification.
Review intent is private acceptance context, not public PR copy: request a few short behavior/proof/material-risk bullets for public prose, with required machine attestation preserved verbatim and separately from that prose.
Public prose must never include private coordination, local paths, task/session/model/captain attribution, or long test transcripts.
Never shorten acceptance criteria or machine attestation to shorten a PR; a publisher that cannot maintain this separation needs a reported correction through its supported gate, not an active-run hand edit.

When it is implemented and committed, push your branch and open a PR with \`gh-axi\`, then append \`done: PR {url}\` to the status file and stop.

This task ships **local-only**: no remote, no PR, no pipeline.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch \`fm/$id\`. Do NOT push, do NOT open a PR, do NOT merge.
Keep your branch a clean fast-forward onto the current default branch - if \`main\` has advanced, rebase onto it so the eventual merge stays a fast-forward.
When it is implemented and committed, append \`done: ready in branch fm/$id\` to the status file and stop.
The configured merge authority approves the ready branch, then firstmate merges it into local \`main\` through the guarded fast-forward path.

# Definition of done
Delivery contract: mode=no-mistakes
After committing the authorized implementation, append \`working: implementation committed; starting validation\` once and proceed directly into no-mistakes on this same worker; no second start instruction is needed.
First reconcile any existing run and its branch custody through structured status; resume an active run rather than starting a duplicate or changing its code.
Reserve \`done:\` for the current-head green PR below, never the implementation commit.

You drive no-mistakes by responding to its gates, not by implementing fixes.
Follow the guidance no-mistakes itself provides for the mechanics: it loads when you invoke /no-mistakes, and \`no-mistakes axi run --help\` plus the \`help\` lines in each \`axi\` response are authoritative and version-matched to the installed binary.
EOF
      fm_dod_intent_contract
      cat <<EOF
Do not hand-edit, commit, or fix findings yourself while a run is active - the pipeline applies every fix.

One drive call blocks until the next gate or outcome, which routinely outlives what your harness lets a single command run: Claude Code kills a command at ten minutes maximum, while one fix round is capped around thirty minutes and up to three rounds chain.
So background the drive call and poll \`no-mistakes axi status\` from a separate call instead of sitting in one blocking hold your harness will kill.
Where a harness's own command limit is not established, assume it bounds commands and use that same background-and-poll shape.
A killed or timed-out call is never evidence the daemon died: the daemon accepts your response immediately and runs the round in the background, so the call was only ever waiting for a read while the run kept working.
Reattach and keep going rather than reporting the pipeline blocked; rule 7 owns the checks that decide when a pipeline block is real.

Two firstmate-specific rules layer on top of that guidance:
- ask-user findings are never yours to answer: escalate to firstmate using rule 6's ask-user format and stop.
  Firstmate applies \`ask-user-authority\` and obtains any required captain decision.
  When the decision comes back, feed it to the gate with \`no-mistakes axi respond\` and let the pipeline apply it - do not route the question to "the user" or implement the fix yourself.
- NEVER pass \`--yes\` (or \`-y\`) to \`no-mistakes axi run\` or \`no-mistakes axi respond\`. It is banned fleet-wide.
  It auto-resolves every gate including ask-user findings with no escalation, and answering your own ask-user finding is a hard rule violation.

After /no-mistakes reports CI green, verify its structured status attributes the passing run and PR to the exact current branch head, not an earlier commit; an unproved or mismatched head is not ready.
At that CI-ready return point, append \`done: PR {url} checks green\` and stop, without waiting for background merge monitoring.
Green CI does not authorize a merge; the configured merge authority remains separate.
