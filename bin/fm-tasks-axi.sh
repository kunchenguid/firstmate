#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-tasks-axi.sh - run tasks-axi against THIS home's backlog from any working directory.
#
# Usage: fm-tasks-axi.sh [<tasks-axi command> [args...]]
#        fm-tasks-axi.sh --help
#
# Every routine firstmate backlog read or mutation goes through this command
# rather than a bare `tasks-axi`; `fm-tasks-axi.sh <command> --help` prints
# tasks-axi's own help. Arguments reach tasks-axi as given, apart from one
# rewrite that keeps file arguments meaning what the caller meant: a relative
# value of `--to` or any `--*-file` flag (`--body-file`, `--relation-file`, ...)
# is made absolute against the caller's working directory, because tasks-axi
# starts from the backlog root instead. `--report` stays as given: tasks-axi
# stores it verbatim as a link, which lifecycle transitions record relative to
# that same root.
#
# Why it exists: a bare `tasks-axi` resolves the tracked `.tasks.toml` paths
# against its working directory, so from the code root it forks the queue
# whenever the home lives elsewhere; docs/configuration.md ("Backlog backend")
# owns that rationale.
#
# Addressing is bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh's fm_backlog_tasks_axi_addressing,
# the same resolution the lifecycle transitions use: tasks-axi runs from the
# configured data directory's parent, so that home's own `.tasks.toml` (or
# tasks-axi's built-in defaults, which keep the archive beside the backlog)
# supplies the adapter, done_keep, and the archive path; a markdown backlog is
# additionally pinned to `<data>/backlog.md` through TASKS_AXI_FILE. The
# environment carries the pin rather than a trailing --file so the no-command
# dashboard works too. A configured non-markdown adapter is addressed by that
# root alone, so an inherited TASKS_AXI_FILE is cleared for it.
#
# The data directory is FM_DATA_OVERRIDE, else $FM_HOME/data, else the code
# root's data/ (FM_HOME unset keeps the single-home layout unchanged).
#
# Refusals (exit 2, nothing run):
#   - tasks-axi missing from PATH;
#   - a caller-supplied --file, because this command owns the addressing and
#     tasks-axi would silently let the last --file win;
#   - a data directory that cannot be resolved, or whose backend configuration
#     cannot be read (bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh owns that diagnostic);
#   - a markdown `<data>/backlog.md` that is itself a symlink, because the
#     first write would replace the link with a private copy, exactly the fork
#     this command exists to prevent. Lifecycle transitions refuse the same file.
# Otherwise the exit status is tasks-axi's own.
