# fm-fleet-view.sh - human renderer over fm-fleet-snapshot.sh.
#
# This command intentionally does not parse fleet state itself.
# It shells out to fm-fleet-snapshot.sh --json and renders that stable
# structured contract for humans.
#
# --cleanup-candidates renders the same snapshot as a kind-labeled cleanup
# report: one row per live task, its kind, whether that kind is disposable or a
# persistent home, and the exact teardown command that kind takes. It exists so
# a cleanup target list is chosen from recorded kinds instead of inferred from a
# worktree path - a path suffix cannot tell a crewmate worktree of the firstmate
# project from a secondmate home, and an idle queue is a healthy secondmate's
# normal state rather than evidence it is finished.

Render a human fleet view from fm-fleet-snapshot.sh.
Use --json to print the underlying snapshot.
Use --cleanup-candidates to list every live task with its kind and the teardown
command that kind takes; it is how cleanup targets are chosen.
