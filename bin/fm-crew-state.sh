#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-crew-state.sh - deterministic read of a crew's CURRENT state.
#
# Why this exists: state/<id>.status is an append-only, best-effort EVENT LOG.
# Crews append only wake-worthy transitions (done/needs-decision/blocked/paused/failed)
# and nothing when they silently resume, so `tail -1` of that log reports the
# last EVENT, not the current STATE. After firstmate resolves a needs-decision
# or blocked and the crew resumes (responds to the gate, the pipeline fixes, it
# re-validates), the log's last line stays stale. This helper never infers the
# current state from a tail of the log: it reads the authoritative source (a
# no-mistakes run-step attributed to this crew's branch and current code
# identity, else the pane busy-signature) and reconciles the possibly-stale log
# against it.
#
# The determinism lives entirely here - only run-step / pane / log reads plus
# fixed mapping logic, no heuristics and no LLM. Output is one stable, parseable,
# token-tight line firstmate can read every heartbeat:
#
#   state: <working|parked|done|blocked|paused|failed|unknown> · source: <run-step|pane|status-log|none> · <detail>
#
# Logic, in order:
#   1. Resolve worktree + backend target + kind from state/<id>.meta.
#   2. Matching no-mistakes run for this crew's branch AND current code identity,
#      active or terminal (from `axi status`, or the coarse `no-mistakes runs`
#      fallback)? Branch name alone is not enough: a historical run on a reused
#      branch whose head was rewritten or diverged must not be attributed.
#      A run matches when its head equals the worktree HEAD, or the worktree HEAD
#      is an ancestor of the run head (pipeline fix commits advanced the run on
#      the same line of history). Local work that advanced past the run head, or
#      diverged from it, invalidates attribution.
#      A run that matched but executed nothing - every step skipped - is not
#      attributed either: its outcome reports on the run, not on the code or the
#      PR. See nm_run_did_no_work for the incident that made that distinction
#      load-bearing.
#      The run-step is AUTHORITATIVE: running/fixing -> working, ci -> working,
#      awaiting_approval/fix_review -> parked (with gate findings), terminal
#      passed/checks-passed -> done, failed/cancelled -> failed. EXCEPT: while
#      the active step is ci, `axi status` alone cannot tell "still waiting on
#      checks" from "checks green, waiting on merge" (see nm_ci_checks_state) -
#      a ci-step log-tail check overrides working -> done once checks read
#      green, so a green PR is never silently read as still-validating.
#   3. Reconcile the status log: if its last line says needs-decision/blocked but
#      the run-step shows the run moved on, the log is deterministically stale and
#      is flagged superseded. A genuinely parked run plus a needs-decision log
#      agree, and are reported as parked.
#   3b. A PARKED run is idle by design (the pipeline waits for the agent), so the
#      run-step alone cannot tell apart a crew composing its gate answer, a crew
#      waiting on a decision, and a wedge. Only for a parked run, the pane and a
#      declared `paused:` line are consulted: a busy pane is reported in the
#      detail (`pane busy`), and otherwise a declared pause is reported as
#      `paused`. Working and terminal run-steps stay untouchable.
#   4. No run for this crew (pre-validation, or kind=scout): fall back to the
#      recorded backend's pane busy state, then the status log's last line only
#      when its verb maps to a recognized run-state. Decision-only events such as
#      `resolved` never become current state or detail.
#   5. Missing meta or torn-down worktree: report unknown · none. If no run is
#      attributed to this crew, a dead endpoint also reports unknown · none rather
#      than trusting a stale status log.
#
# Read-only and side-effect free. Always exits 0 on a successful read regardless
# of state; exit 2 only on a usage error (no id).

# Coarse fallback for cross-branch attribution. `no-mistakes axi status` (bare)
# reports the active-or-most-recent run for the CURRENT branch when one

# display (verified empirically: querying a worktree with its own active run
# reliably returns that run, even under concurrent load from several other
# validating crews on the same underlying repo). A crew whose branch genuinely
# has no run yet therefore sees another branch's answer here.
#
# This fallback used to shell out to `no-mistakes axi` (bare, no subcommand)
# expecting a `runs[N]{id,branch,status,...}:` TOON table and re-query the
# matched id via `axi status --run <id>`. Verified against the real installed
# CLI (v1.32.2): the `axi` surface exposes only abort/logs/respond/run/status -
# there is no runs-listing subcommand under `axi` at all, so that table never
# appears and the lookup was silently dead code; whenever the bare `axi
# status` answer was not this crew's own branch, attribution always failed and
# the caller fell straight through to the pane/log fallback below. (The
# PRIMARY cause of the 2026-07 herdr false-surface incidents turned out to be
# a separate bug in bin/fm-watch.sh's stale_is_terminal precedence - see that
# file's history - but this cross-branch path was independently confirmed
# dead code and is worth having actually work.)
#
# The real run-listing command is the top-level `no-mistakes runs` (verified:
# `no-mistakes --help` lists it separately from `axi`). It is plain, human-
# oriented text - no run id, no JSON/TOON, newest-first, columns
# "<status> <branch> <short-sha> <date> [<pr-url>]" separated by runs of
# spaces (verified: no quoting, so splitting on the first two whitespace runs
# is exact) - but branch + coarse status is exactly what this predicate needs:
# is a run for THIS branch active right now. Echoes the first (most recent)

# The 2026-07-28 false green: firstmate armed an escalate-only watch on MR 43,
# the run ended 2ms later with its single step `watch,skipped,0,2` and
# `outcome: passed`, and this script - which reads `outcome: passed` as "PR
# merged/closed" - reported `state: done · source: run-step · run passed: PR
# merged/closed` for a task whose MR was open with red CI. The outcome word was
# accurate about the RUN and said nothing about the PR; only the steps table
# distinguishes the two. A run that skipped everything is not evidence, so it is
# not attributed at all, and state falls back to the pane and status log as if
# no run existed. Deliberately narrow: one completed, failed, or running step
# anywhere makes the run real again, so no genuine pipeline run is discarded.

  # A PARKED run is idle BY DESIGN: the pipeline is waiting for the agent (or,

  # run-step alone cannot say whether the crew is composing its answer, waiting
  # on a decision firstmate already escalated, or wedged. Two facts settle it,
  # and until 2026-07-13 the run-step path consulted neither:
  #
  #   pane busy  - the crew is actively working on its gate response. Reported in
  #                the detail so the classifier (fm-classify-lib.sh) can absorb it
  #                instead of calling an actively-working crew a possible wedge.
  #   paused:    - a DECLARED external wait (the crew's or firstmate's own append,
  #                e.g. "paused: awaiting captain decision on the review-gate
  #                findings"). The whole point of the verb is "this idle pane is
  #                expected, stop wedge-nagging it" - but a parked run made this
  #                path report `parked`, which is neither working nor paused, so
  #                the watcher re-surfaced the crew as stale every poll. Verified
  #                live 2026-07-13 on nm-6951-fullflow-e2e.
