#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Merge a task's PR, always recording pr= and any available pr_head= into
# state/<id>.meta first via bin/fm-pr-check.sh, so bin/fm-teardown.sh's
# landed-check has a PR reference to verify a squash merge against.
#
# Why this exists: the normal trigger for running fm-pr-check.sh is the crew's
# `done: PR <url> checks green` line, which no-mistakes only emits once its CI
# step turns green. Repos that intentionally run no CI on PRs (CI only on
# pushes to the default branch) never emit that line, so a merge performed by
# hand-running `gh-axi pr merge` - the common shape of a yolo-authorized merge -
# can skip the recording step entirely. Teardown then has nothing to look up for
# a squash-merge-then-delete-branch flow and false-refuses provably landed work.
# This script makes recording part of the merge itself, so it cannot be skipped
# by omission. Use it for every PR merge (captain-requested or yolo-authorized),
# in place of calling `gh-axi pr merge` directly.
#
# gh-axi pr merge expects a PR number and --repo <owner>/<repo>; it does not
# parse a full https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<n> URL. This script
# parses the URL (via bin/fm-pr-lib.sh) and invokes gh-axi in the form it accepts.
#
# Hooks: the pr-ready hook point belongs to the recording step, so when this run
# is the first to record pr= (that same no-CI-repo flow), it fires here rather
# than inside fm-pr-check.sh - after the merge, so it can never delay it - and
# still exactly once per (task, PR URL). post-merge fires after it.
#
# Merge method: defaults to --squash when the caller passes none of --squash,
# --merge, --rebase, or --method after the optional -- separator. An explicit
# caller method is never overridden.
# Extra args must not include --repo or -R because the repo is parsed from the
# PR URL.
# Usage: fm-pr-merge.sh <task-id> <pr-url> [-- <extra gh-axi pr merge args>]
