#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Merge a task's PR or MR after recording pr= and any available pr_head= through
# bin/fm-pr-check.sh, so teardown can verify landed work after squash merges.
# The full canonical URL is parsed by bin/fm-pr-lib.sh. A GitHub pull request is
# addressed through gh-axi by the derived owner and repository; a GitLab merge
# request is addressed through glab by the project URL rebuilt from the parsed
# host and path, so any instance works and no host is hardcoded; a Gitea/Forgejo
# pull request is addressed through tea by the derived owner and repository plus
# the tea login whose own endpoint matches the parsed host's endpoint.
#
# Merge method on GitHub defaults to --squash when the caller passes none of
# --squash, --merge, --rebase, or --method after the optional -- separator.
# The gh-axi merge abstraction always performs the merge; the outcome read that
# follows it never becomes a prerequisite for reaching that abstraction. After
# gh-axi returns success, GitHub's live state is read back and accepted only
# when the pull request is merged or in the merge queue. gh's GraphQL API
# supplies that queue-aware read when gh is on PATH; when gh is absent or its
# read fails, gh-axi's own view still proves a landed merge, and every outcome
# it cannot prove refuses, reporting the single failed read when gh is absent
# and naming both failed reads when gh is present and its own read failed.
# If the pull request remains open and the base branch has an effective
# merge_queue rule, the refusal names the queue's configured merge method and
# the exact -- --auto --<method> retry flags, unless the caller already passed
# that method with --auto to a merge command that returned success, in which
# case it reports instead that the accepted request has not entered the queue
# and the queue state has to be re-checked.
# No method is selected for the caller in any case. A rules response that names
# no queue rule, one that could not be read, rules that disagree, and a method
# this script does not recognise are four distinct outcomes and are reported
# apart, because each one leaves the operator somewhere different.
# A caller-requested --auto that leaves the pull request neither merged nor
# queued is refused the same way and says auto-merge was armed with nothing
# landed or queued yet, or, when the merge command itself failed, that auto-merge
# was only requested; both are read from the caller's own arguments rather than
# from the forge's prose. The observed state is judged the same way whichever
# read produced it, and a refusal built on the gh-axi view says the merge queue
# could not be observed at all rather than implying an unqueued pull request.
# Every refusal that follows a merge command which returned success quotes that
# command's own output, marked as the forge's text and kept apart from this
# script's verdict, including the refusal for an outcome that cannot be read;
# a merge command that failed keeps its original error surfaced raw and first.
# GitLab adds no method flag at all: its merge method is the project's own
# setting, which the merge API applies, and imposing squash there would override
# that convention rather than mirror the GitHub default. Gitea/Forgejo defaults
# to --style squash when the caller passes no --style(=...)/-s.
#
# A GitLab merge is refused unless every pre-merge condition holds, each read
# live at merge time rather than taken from recorded metadata: the merge request
# is open, detailed_merge_status is mergeable, has_conflicts is false,
# blocking_discussions_resolved is true, and the head pipeline succeeded at the
# exact current head commit. Every failing condition is reported, not just the
# first. The verified head is then passed to glab as --sha, so a push that lands
# between that read and the merge fails the merge instead of landing commits
# nothing verified. A recorded pr_head that disagrees with the live head is
# reported rather than trusted, because a rebase moves the head and leaves the
# recorded value stale. Reading that state needs glab and jq, and either one
# absent stops the merge before any state is recorded. tea has no head-commit
# field in any output format, so no equivalent live-head verification is
# performed for Gitea/Forgejo.
#
# tea addresses a self-hosted instance through a configured login rather than
# through the URL, so the merge path resolves the login whose own endpoint
# matches the validated record's endpoint, refusing loudly on any ambiguity or
# absence because merging is a deliberate action with one clear point to
# report it.
#
# Extra args must not include --repo, --login, --remote, or -R in any form,
# including a bundled short-option cluster such as -yR, because the
# repository and, for Gitea/Forgejo, the tea login come only from the URL.
# tea's --remote/-R discovers the login from a configured remote, which is
# just as much a repository override as --repo/--login: rejecting -R alone
# and letting --remote through would leave the override reachable by its
# long form. On Gitea/Forgejo only, -r and -l are rejected too, since tea
# maps them to --repo/--login; on GitHub, -r is the legitimate --rebase
# merge-method flag and is preserved.
# Extra args must also not include --sha on GitLab, because the head comes
# only from the live read.
#
# On GitLab, this script confirms the MR is actually merged before reporting it;
# an auto-merge-queued or unconfirmed request leaves the poll armed and records
# no landed outcome. bin/fm-merge-outcome-lib.sh owns a confirmed merge's
# destination, normal-case deduplication, and at-least-once recovery.
# A landed merge whose outcome cannot be written is reported loudly rather than
# misreported as a failed merge.
# Usage: fm-pr-merge.sh <task-id> <pr-url> [-- <extra forge merge args>]
