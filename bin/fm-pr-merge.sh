#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Merge a task's PR or MR after recording pr= and any available pr_head= through
# bin/fm-pr-check.sh, so teardown can verify landed work after squash merges.
# The full canonical URL is parsed by bin/fm-pr-lib.sh. A GitHub pull request is
# addressed through gh-axi by the derived owner and repository; a GitLab merge
# request is addressed through glab by the project URL rebuilt from the parsed
# host and path, so any instance works and no host is hardcoded.
#
# Merge method on GitHub defaults to --squash when the caller passes none of
# --squash, --merge, --rebase, or --method after the optional -- separator.
# GitLab adds no method flag at all: its merge method is the project's own
# setting, which the merge API applies, and imposing squash there would override
# that convention rather than mirror the GitHub default.
#
# A GitLab merge is refused unless every pre-merge condition holds, each read
# live at merge time rather than taken from recorded metadata: the merge request
# is open, detailed_merge_status is mergeable, has_conflicts is false,
# blocking_discussions_resolved is true, and the head pipeline succeeded at the
# exact current head commit. Every failing condition is reported, not just the
# first. The verified head is then passed to glab as --sha, so a push that lands
# between that read and the merge fails the merge instead of landing commits
# nothing verified. A recorded pr_head that disagrees with the live head is
# reported rather than trusted, because a rebase moves the head and leaves the
# recorded value stale. Reading that state needs glab and jq, and either one
# absent stops the merge before any state is recorded.
#
# Extra args must not include --repo or -R in any form, including a bundled
# short-option cluster such as -yR, because the repository comes only from the
# URL, nor --sha on GitLab because the head comes only from the live read.
#
# ATOMIC TEARDOWN AND BACKLOG COMPLETION. A merge that succeeds is followed by
# bin/fm-teardown.sh <task-id>, then - only once that succeeds - tasks-axi done
# <task-id> --pr <url>, so an operator running this one script gets all three
# effects instead of three separately-remembered commands. Passing --no-teardown
# (anywhere before the optional -- separator) skips both follow-on steps and
# leaves the merge step's own behavior exactly as before, for a caller with its
# own reason to defer cleanup.
# Neither follow-on step runs any bypass: a teardown refusal (its own hard-won
# guard against discarding unlanded work elsewhere in the worktree) is reported
# verbatim and stops the chain with a non-zero exit before tasks-axi done ever
# runs, because the merge having landed does not make that refusal any less
# real. tasks-axi done runs only when config/backlog-backend is not "manual"
# and a compatible tasks-axi is on PATH (bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh's own
# availability check); a manual backend leaves the operator with teardown's own
# printed backlog-refresh reminder, exactly as today. A non-manual backend
# whose tasks-axi is missing or too old is not treated the same as a deliberate
# manual backend: it is a merge-chain failure reported with a non-zero exit,
# because staying silent there would report success while the backlog record
# stayed in flight.
# Usage: fm-pr-merge.sh <task-id> <pr-url> [--no-teardown] [-- <extra forge merge args>]
