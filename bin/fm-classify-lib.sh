# Shared wake classifier: the common source of truth for captain-relevant status
# tests, declared-external-wait vocabulary, and the working/paused absorb
# classification that makes no-verb signal and stale-pane wakes safe to absorb.
# Sourced by BOTH the always-on watcher
# (bin/fm-watch.sh) and the away-mode daemon (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh) so the
# overlapping triage policy lives in one place instead of two copies that can
# drift apart.
#
# Most functions are pure, side-effect-free reads of status files: each takes
# what it needs as arguments and touches no globals beyond the optional
# FM_CAPTAIN_RE override. Consumers layer their own dedup/marker state on top (the
# daemon keeps its escalation-digest seen-markers; the watcher keeps its .seen-*
# signatures).
#
# The one exception is the absorb classification (crew_absorb_class and its
# working/paused wrappers). It is NOT a pure status-file read: it reuses
# bin/fm-crew-state.sh, which may make a bounded no-mistakes call, to decide
# whether a crew that just stopped its turn or went stale is working, deliberately
# paused, or neither. Callers run it ONLY on no-verb signal handling and first
# sighting of a stale hash, never on every wake, so the per-wake triage stays
# cheap.

# The status stream is an append-only EVENT log. Reading it last-event-wins

# masks a still-open needs-decision. status_open_decisions is the ONE authoritative

# keyed decision, and ONLY an explicit resolution referencing that key CLOSES it; a
# later unrelated terminal line never clears an open captain decision.

# A line with no token uses the key "default", preserving the historical
