# Self-update a running firstmate and its secondmates to the latest origin.
#
# Mechanical half of the /updatefirstmate skill. Fast-forwards the running
# firstmate repo's default branch from origin, then fast-forwards every
# registered secondmate home. Local homes are treehouse worktrees or standalone
# clones; remote routes update their configured code root on that host and then
# fast-forward the persistent home to that root. FAST-FORWARD ONLY, exactly like
# fm-fleet-sync.sh: never force, never create a merge commit, never stash;
# advance a target only when it is a clean fast-forward, otherwise skip and
# report. A tracked-files fast-forward never touches the gitignored operational
# dirs (data/, state/, config/, projects/, .no-mistakes/), so a secondmate's
# in-flight work is never disrupted. Worktrees of this repo share one object
# store, so a single fetch refreshes them all; standalone-clone homes are
# fetched on their own. Secondmate homes are leased at a detached HEAD on the
# default branch, so a fast-forward there advances HEAD only and never touches
# any other worktree's checkout or the shared `main` branch.
#
# The fast-forward mechanics live in bin/fm-ff-lib.sh (base_mode "origin" here);
# the same library drives the local-HEAD secondmate sync used by fm-spawn.sh and
# fm-bootstrap.sh, so there is one ff implementation, not several.
#
# It does NOT re-read AGENTS.md or nudge secondmates itself - those are LLM /
# tmux actions the skill performs. The script's job is the safe git mechanics
# plus a parseable summary telling the caller what to do next:
#   - one status line per target (updated/already current/skipped)
#   - nm-watch-capability: ok|incompatible (upgrade: ...)|absent
#       (does the local no-mistakes expose the `watch` command direct-PR
#        monitoring needs; detection only, the skill owns any authorized upgrade)
#   - reread-firstmate: yes|no    (did the running firstmate's instructions change)
#   - nudge-secondmates: fm-<id>...|none   (updated live secondmates to nudge)
#
# Usage: fm-update.sh [--help]

# there must never revert the fast-forward this run just completed. The probe is
