# not duplicate the beacon math. Because the watcher touches its beacon every
# poll cycle, a normal fire leaves a recent beacon well inside grace and stays
# silent; only a genuine stale-beyond-grace lapse with work in flight warns. Call
# after the queue is emptied so guard never re-prints its own queued-wakes notice
# for the records this run just drained, and never let a guard hiccup change the
