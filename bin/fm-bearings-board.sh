#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-bearings-board.sh - build the /bearings local HTML fleet board.
#
# The board is the captain-facing read-only surface of /bearings lavish: the
# shipped template (.agents/skills/bearings/assets/board-template.html) plus one
# injected fm-bearings-board.v1 JSON payload. This script owns the mechanics so
# the invoking agent's per-run work stays "compose the JSON, run build" - the
# agent never authors board UI at invocation time.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-bearings-board.sh build <data.json>
#   fm-bearings-board.sh path
#
# build      Validate the payload, drop the Captain's Call cards whose subject
#            already landed, and inject the effective payload into a fresh copy
#            of the shipped template at the stable board path. This home does
#            not run lavish-axi or register an answer source; the captain opens
#            the HTML file in a browser and answers in chat. Output starts with
#            `board: <path>`, then:
#              served: <path>
#              open: <path>
#            Every dropped card is named on stderr as a `dropped-landed-card:`
#            line, so a rebuild states what it removed instead of quietly
#            shrinking Captain's Call.
# path       Print the stable board path for this home.
#
# CAPTAIN'S CALL HYGIENE. A decision card is dropped when its work item, PR, or
# structured artifact/version subject appears among the payload's own landed
# rows, or when `bin/fm-captain-hold.sh open` reports the task is no longer an
# open captain call. A newer published version also supersedes a version card.
# A task whose state cannot be established is kept, because a call wrongly
# hidden is worse than a card wrongly shown. Cleanup is therefore a normal
# rebuild effect rather than a committed migration or direct state mutation.
#
# Validation is fail-closed: the payload must be valid JSON with
# schema=fm-bearings-board.v1 and every renderer-consumed field must satisfy
# the fm-bearings-board.v1 types and item invariants below. Every fleet row and
# Captain's Call item explicitly carries `repo`; the composer fills it from the
# snapshot and task records wherever known, and uses null or an empty string
# only as the deliberate genuinely-no-repo marker. In that exceptional case
# the template may display the routing id. Anything else refuses before the
# existing board is touched.
#
# The board path is stable - $FM_HOME/.lavish/bearings-board.html - so a
# re-invocation rebuilds the same file in place. The directory name is retained
# for path compatibility only; there is no Lavish session or polling.
# Injection escapes every `<` in the compact JSON as the \u003c string escape,
# so a payload string containing "</script>" can never terminate the data block
# early.
#
# FM_BEARINGS_BOARD_TEMPLATE overrides the shipped template path (tests only).
