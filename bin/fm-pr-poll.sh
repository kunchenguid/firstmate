#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Static watcher program for a validated PR/MR poll sidecar.
# It emits exactly one merged line for a merged PR or MR. On GitHub it also
# emits one closed line for a pull request closed without merging, and one open
# line for one that is still open. It stays silent on every other reading and on
# every error, so a failed lookup can never be read as a merge and a closed pull
# request is never reported as one. A closed pull request is not a failure - its
# work may have landed in a successor - so the two are distinct results and
# firstmate reconciles the closed one. The open line wakes nobody: it is the
# positive reading the watcher uses to forget an earlier closure, so a pull
# request that is reopened and closed again wakes a second time. Silence must
# never do that, because silence also means an unreadable pull request or a
# failed CLI lookup.
# The GitLab path emits merged only: the token glab prints for a closed merge
# request could not be verified against a real glab here, and an unverified token
# would make that half a silent no-op, so it is deliberately left out of scope.
# The provider-tagged identity is data in the sidecar and is never
# interpolated into this source: these bytes are identical for every task.
# Each provider is read through its own standard CLI, gh for GitHub and glab
# for GitLab, so an upstream checkout needs no extra tooling to follow either.
