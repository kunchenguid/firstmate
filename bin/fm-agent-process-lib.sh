# Backend-neutral harness-process identity.
# Sourced by bin/backends/tmux.sh and bin/backends/herdr.sh, and by
# bin/fm-spawn.sh, whose post-`treehouse get` wait uses the same shell verdict
# to tell a returned shell from an acquisition still under way. This file is
# sourced by scripts and has no side effects on source.
#
# Why one owner: every runtime backend that proves an agent is alive does it by
# attributing operating-system processes - the pane's foreground process group
# on tmux, Herdr's `pane process-info` view plus the pane shell's descendants
# on Herdr - and the two must agree on what a given process name means, or a
# harness one backend recognizes silently reads as a dead pane on the other.
# The classifier moved here verbatim from the tmux adapter, where it was born;
# docs/tmux-backend.md "Agent liveness probe" owns the empirical basis for the
# names below, and tests/fm-tmux-agent-liveness.test.sh plus
# tests/fm-harness-liveness-drift-live-e2e.test.sh keep them honest.
