# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute.
One rule up front:

**Human-authored pull requests targeting `main` must be raised through [`no-mistakes`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes).**
We require this to reduce the maintainer's burden of reviewing and merging contributions.

`no-mistakes` puts a local git proxy in front of your real remote.
Pushing through it runs an AI-driven review/test/lint pipeline in an isolated worktree, forwards the push upstream only after every check passes, and opens a clean PR automatically.

A GitHub Actions check (`Require no-mistakes`) runs on PRs targeting `main` and fails if the body is missing the deterministic signature that no-mistakes writes.
Dependency bots are exempt so their automation keeps working, but regular contributor PRs without the signature will not be reviewed or merged.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo, then clone the parent repo or set your local `origin` back to the parent (`git@github.com:kunchenguid/firstmate.git`).
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Initialize the gate with your fork as the push target: `no-mistakes init --fork-url git@github.com:<you>/firstmate.git` (firstmate expects **no-mistakes v1.31.2+**; without a fork, plain `no-mistakes init` still works for maintainers with push access).
4. Commit your changes.
5. Push through the gate instead of pushing to `origin`:

   ```sh
   git push no-mistakes
   ```

6. Run `no-mistakes` to attach to the pipeline, watch findings, authorize auto-fixes, and review ask-user findings as needed.
   Follow the installed no-mistakes version's SKILL.md and live `axi` help for gate mechanics.
7. Once the pipeline passes, it pushes the branch to your fork and opens the PR against the parent repo for you.

## Repo conventions

- This repo is a template for running a firstmate orchestrator agent.
  `AGENTS.md` is the agent's main job description and names when to load bundled firstmate skills; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, and `.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills`.
- Only shared material is tracked: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, `.agents/skills/`, `skills/`, and provider-neutral components under `tools/`.
  `.agents/skills/` holds agent-loaded skills that assume a live firstmate home and carry `metadata.internal: true` so installers such as [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) hide them from discovery; `skills/` holds standalone, installer-facing public skills with no firstmate dependency (see the README's "Two-tier skill layout").
  Everything personal to one captain's fleet (`.env`, `data/`, `state/`, `config/`, `projects/`, `.no-mistakes/`) is gitignored; never commit it.
  The root `.tasks.toml` is tracked `tasks-axi` config for `data/backlog.md`; compatible `tasks-axi` is the default backend for routine backlog mutations, with the compatibility definition owned by [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) ("Backlog backend").
  A local `config/backlog-backend=manual` opt-out forces firstmate's routine backlog updates to hand-editing and stays gitignored; validated secondmate handoffs still delegate through `tasks-axi mv`.
  A local `config/backend` file explicitly overrides runtime auto-detection for new task endpoints and stays gitignored; spawn-supported values are `tmux` plus experimental `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, and `cmux`, while `codex-app` is documented only in `docs/codex-app-backend.md`.
  It does not make `data/` tracked.
- Helper scripts in `bin/` are plain bash.
  Each starts with a usage header comment; keep it accurate when you change behavior.
  Test scripts and helpers in `tests/` are plain bash too.
  `bin/fm-lint.sh` must pass: it is the single owner of the lint definition (the shellcheck file set, config, and pinned shellcheck version), and both CI and the no-mistakes pre-push gate run it, so local and CI can never diverge.
  It pins one exact shellcheck version and refuses to run under any other; print it with `bin/fm-lint.sh --required-version` and install that build locally.
- Changes to harness adapters (detection in `bin/fm-harness.sh`, launch and hook mechanics in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, busy signatures in `bin/fm-watch.sh` and `bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh`, cleanup in `bin/fm-teardown.sh`, and facts in `.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`) must be verified empirically against the real harness, never written from documentation alone.
- Changes to runtime session backends (`bin/fm-backend.sh`, `bin/backends/`, and the scripts that dispatch through them) need empirical adapter notes in the relevant backend guide: `docs/tmux-backend.md`, `docs/herdr-backend.md`, `docs/zellij-backend.md`, `docs/orca-backend.md`, `docs/cmux-backend.md`, or `docs/codex-app-backend.md` for blocked Codex App transport work.
- In Markdown, put each full sentence on its own line.
- `README.md` stays a concise overview plus pointers: it never carries a wall of inline detail.
  Route detail to the most specific `docs/` file (architecture, configuration, or a backend guide) and link to it instead.

## Development

Changes to the shared tracked material listed under "Repo conventions" ship through the `no-mistakes` pipeline on a feature branch and require an explicit merge approval.
Before making any such change, load the agent-only `firstmate-coding-guidelines` skill (`.agents/skills/firstmate-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md`).
It has the knowledge-placement rules that keep `AGENTS.md` from regrowing after each diet pass.
There is no reliable way for `bin/fm-brief.sh`'s scaffold to detect that a task's repo is firstmate itself, so firstmate adds this skill's load line to firstmate-repo briefs by hand.
A crewmate picking up such a brief should load the skill even if the brief predates this instruction.
When supervising live crewmates, keep firstmate's own long validation or build commands in the background so watcher wakes can still be handled.
Crewmate validation follows the installed no-mistakes version's SKILL.md and live `axi` help instead of duplicating gate mechanics in firstmate docs.
Firstmate's wrapper still matters: `ask-user` findings route to the captain through firstmate, and crewmates avoid `--yes` because it silently resolves captain-owned decisions without escalation.
Local `.no-mistakes/` state and test evidence stay out of this repo; `.no-mistakes.yaml` keeps evidence in a temp directory and pins the gate's shell and Agent Fleet source checks to their matching CI commands.
That is firstmate-specific; do not commit `.no-mistakes/evidence/` here even when another no-mistakes-managed target project keeps committed PR evidence.

Check and test the toolbelt before pushing:

```sh
for script in bin/*.sh bin/backends/*.sh; do bash -n "$script"; done   # syntax-check the toolbelt
bin/fm-lint.sh   # lint the toolbelt and behavior tests; the single owner CI and the no-mistakes gate both run
for test_script in tests/*.test.sh; do case "$test_script" in tests/fm-afk-launch.test.sh|tests/fm-backend-autodetect-smoke.test.sh|tests/fm-backend-herdr-workspace-per-home-e2e.test.sh) continue ;; esac; bash "$test_script"; done   # behavior tests safe for a developer checkout
[ "$(readlink CLAUDE.md)" = "AGENTS.md" ]
[ "$(readlink .claude/skills)" = "../.agents/skills" ]
tmp=$(mktemp -d) && printf 'done: smoke\n' > "$tmp/smoke.status" && FM_STATE_OVERRIDE="$tmp" FM_SIGNAL_GRACE=1 FM_POLL=1 FM_HEARTBEAT=999999 bin/fm-watch-arm.sh  # watcher re-arm smoke test (prints arm status, then an actionable signal)
```

Agent Fleet is independently packaged under `tools/agent-fleet` and requires Python 3.11 or newer plus `uv`.
Run the complete locked verification in [`tools/agent-fleet/RELEASING.md`](tools/agent-fleet/RELEASING.md) before pushing; that document also owns versioning, tagging, and clean-install verification.

Discover tests by listing `tests/*.test.sh`: each is a self-contained bash script named `<subject>.test.sh`, and its header comment describes what it covers, so run one directly to focus on a subject.
When triaging a red `Behavior tests` job, remember that CI runs that loop under `set -eu` while the local loop above does not: CI stops at the first failing script, so its log proves nothing about the suites that sort after it, and a red job is a lower bound on the failure count rather than the whole list.
Reproduce with the exclusion-aware local loop to see every safe failure at once before concluding which ones are real.
Reproduce in a checkout whose `origin` is the repository's https URL, as CI's own checkout is: the secondmate network-authority fixtures assert that the product pins the resolved address of the origin host, and a checkout whose `origin` is a local filesystem path has no host to pin, so those cases refuse for a reason that exists only locally.
Run the suites from a checkout sitting on its default branch, not from a task-branch worktree - the worktree-tangle guard fires and several secondmate suites require the default branch, which produces more failures that are pure local artifacts.
Do not run `tests/fm-afk-launch.test.sh`, `tests/fm-backend-autodetect-smoke.test.sh`, or `tests/fm-backend-herdr-workspace-per-home-e2e.test.sh` on a developer checkout: they act on the DEFAULT Herdr workspace where the live crewmate fleet runs and can destroy other agents' unlanded work.
CI runs them safely only because its runner is disposable and carries no fleet.
Use `bin/fm-brief.sh --herdr-lab` for these suites; it owns the isolation contract requiring a never-default lab session, a trailing `--session` on every Herdr call, guarded teardown, and a before/after fleet-state tripwire.
Other tests that need a real optional backend, an explicit opt-in, or an ambient toolchain capability (real zellij/cmux smoke tests, the live Pi regression, the Pi TypeScript-extension checks when node cannot import `.ts` modules directly) skip themselves and print the tool or environment gate needed to enable them.
