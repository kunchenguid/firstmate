# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute.
One rule up front:

**Human-authored pull requests targeting `main` must be raised through [`no-mistakes`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes).**
We require this to reduce the maintainer's burden of reviewing and merging contributions.

`no-mistakes` puts a local git proxy in front of your real remote.
Pushing through it runs an AI-driven review/test/lint pipeline in an isolated worktree, forwards the push upstream only after every check passes, and opens a clean PR automatically.

A GitHub Actions check (`Require no-mistakes`) runs on PRs targeting `main` and fails if the body is missing the deterministic signature that no-mistakes writes.
It evaluates every PR opening and body edit independently, so a later edit cannot replace an earlier pending compliance check.
GitHub Actions and Dependabot are exempt so their automation keeps working, but regular contributor PRs without the signature will not be reviewed or merged.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo, then clone the parent repo or set your local `origin` back to the parent (`git@github.com:kunchenguid/firstmate.git`).
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Initialize the gate with your fork as the push target: `no-mistakes init --fork-url git@github.com:<you>/firstmate.git` (firstmate expects **no-mistakes v1.31.2+**; without a fork, plain `no-mistakes init` still works for maintainers with push access).
4. Commit your changes.
5. Push through the gate instead of pushing to `origin`:

   ```sh
   git push no-mistakes
   ```

6. Run `no-mistakes` to attach to the pipeline, watch findings, authorize auto-fixes, and review ask-user findings as needed.
   Follow the installed no-mistakes version's SKILL.md and live `axi` help for gate mechanics.
7. Once the pipeline passes, it pushes the branch to your fork and opens the PR against the parent repo for you.

## Repo conventions

- This repo is a template for running a firstmate orchestrator agent.
  `AGENTS.md` is the agent's main job description and names when to load bundled firstmate skills; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, and `.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills`.
- Only shared material is tracked: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `skills/`.
  `.agents/skills/` holds agent-loaded skills that assume a live firstmate home and carry `metadata.internal: true` so installers such as [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) hide them from discovery; `skills/` holds standalone, installer-facing public skills with no firstmate dependency (see the README's "Two-tier skill layout").
  Everything personal to one captain's fleet (`.env`, `data/`, `state/`, `config/`, `projects/`, `.no-mistakes/`) is gitignored; never commit it.
  The root `.tasks.toml` is tracked `tasks-axi` config for `data/backlog.md`; compatible `tasks-axi` is the default backend for routine backlog mutations, with the compatibility definition owned by [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) ("Backlog backend").
  A local `config/backlog-backend=manual` opt-out forces firstmate's routine backlog updates to hand-editing and stays gitignored; validated secondmate handoffs still delegate through `tasks-axi mv`.
  A local `config/backend` file explicitly overrides runtime auto-detection for new task endpoints and stays gitignored; spawn-supported values are `tmux` plus experimental `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, and `cmux`, while `codex-app` is documented only in `docs/codex-app-backend.md`.
  It does not make `data/` tracked.
- Helper scripts in `bin/` are plain bash.
  Each starts with a usage header comment; keep it accurate when you change behavior.
  Test scripts and helpers in `tests/` are plain bash too.
  `bin/fm-lint.sh` must pass: it is the single owner of the lint definition (the shellcheck file set, config, and pinned shellcheck version), and both CI and the no-mistakes pre-push gate run it, so local and CI can never diverge.
  It pins one exact shellcheck version and refuses to run under any other; print it with `bin/fm-lint.sh --required-version` and install that build locally.
- Changes to harness adapters (detection in `bin/fm-harness.sh`, launch and hook mechanics in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, busy signatures in `bin/fm-watch.sh` and `bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh`, cleanup in `bin/fm-teardown.sh`, and facts in `.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`) must be verified empirically against the real harness, never written from documentation alone.
- Changes to runtime session backends (`bin/fm-backend.sh`, `bin/backends/`, and the scripts that dispatch through them) need empirical adapter notes in the relevant backend guide: `docs/tmux-backend.md`, `docs/herdr-backend.md`, `docs/zellij-backend.md`, `docs/orca-backend.md`, `docs/cmux-backend.md`, or `docs/codex-app-backend.md` for blocked Codex App transport work.
- In Markdown, put each full sentence on its own line.
- `README.md` stays a concise overview plus pointers: it never carries a wall of inline detail.
  Route detail to the most specific `docs/` file (architecture, configuration, or a backend guide) and link to it instead.

## Development

Tracked changes to firstmate itself - `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `skills/` - ship through the `no-mistakes` pipeline on a feature branch and require an explicit merge approval.
Before making any such change, load the agent-only `firstmate-coding-guidelines` skill (`.agents/skills/firstmate-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md`).
It has the knowledge-placement rules that keep `AGENTS.md` from regrowing after each diet pass.
There is no reliable way for `bin/fm-brief.sh`'s scaffold to detect that a task's repo is firstmate itself, so firstmate adds this skill's load line to firstmate-repo briefs by hand.
A crewmate picking up such a brief should load the skill even if the brief predates this instruction.
When supervising live crewmates, keep firstmate's own long validation or build commands in the background so watcher wakes can still be handled.
Crewmate validation follows the installed no-mistakes version's SKILL.md and live `axi` help instead of duplicating gate mechanics in firstmate docs.
Firstmate's wrapper still matters: `ask-user` findings route to the captain through firstmate, and crewmates avoid `--yes` because it silently resolves captain-owned decisions without escalation.
Local `.no-mistakes/` state and test evidence stay out of this repo; `.no-mistakes.yaml` keeps evidence in a temp directory and pins the gate's lint command to `bin/fm-lint.sh`, matching the Linux CI lint job.
Local no-mistakes Test is intent-targeted and must not re-run every `tests/*.test.sh`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the broad behavior suite plus platform-specific compatibility lanes.
That is firstmate-specific; do not commit `.no-mistakes/evidence/` here even when another no-mistakes-managed target project keeps committed PR evidence.

Check and test the toolbelt before pushing:

```sh
for script in bin/*.sh bin/backends/*.sh; do bash -n "$script"; done   # syntax-check the toolbelt
bin/fm-lint.sh   # lint the toolbelt and behavior tests; the single owner CI and the no-mistakes gate both run
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/<subject>.test.sh   # one script (primary local focus path, timed)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --family pure-contract-unit   # ordinary family-scoped local path (serial, timed)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --changed   # conservative changed-file-informed set (never silent full suite)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --proven-isolated --jobs 4   # explicit local parallel of the proven set only (default is serial)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --lane portable-serial   # portable serial remainder (watcher/AFK/tmux/stateful)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage   # prove portable shards + serial + Herdr equal the full inventory
bin/fm-test-run.sh --all   # deliberate complete regression (optional local full walk; not no-mistakes Test)
bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh --list   # proven parallel candidate set (Phase 2 owner)
bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh --jobs 4 --json /tmp/fm-isolation-proof.json   # re-run concurrent isolation proof only
[ "$(readlink CLAUDE.md)" = "AGENTS.md" ]
[ "$(readlink .claude/skills)" = "../.agents/skills" ]
tmp=$(mktemp -d) && printf 'done: smoke\n' > "$tmp/smoke.status" && FM_STATE_OVERRIDE="$tmp" FM_SIGNAL_GRACE=1 FM_POLL=1 FM_HEARTBEAT=999999 bin/fm-watch-arm.sh  # watcher re-arm smoke test (prints arm status, then an actionable signal)
```

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` is the single owner of behavior-suite selection, portable CI lane composition, optional local `--jobs` for the proven-isolated set only, per-script timing markers, family totals, the coverage guard, and the optional JSON timing artifact.
Its header and `--help` own the flags, family labels, lanes, and changed-file map; this section only documents the entry points.
`bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh` remains the single owner of the Phase 2 concurrent isolation proof and the exact proven candidate set; see `docs/fm-test-isolation-proof.md`.
Portable shard balance evidence lives in `docs/fm-test-portable-shards.md`.
Local no-mistakes Test stays intent-targeted and must not wire `commands.test` to `--all` or a `tests/*.test.sh` walk.
Family selection is the ordinary local path; `--all` is deliberate full regression only.
CI owns broad regression across required portable parallel shards, the portable serial lane, the Herdr lane, lint, invariants, the coverage guard, and macOS snapshot compatibility in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
Use `bin/fm-test-run.sh --help` for lane names, `--jobs` rules, and required gate-skip flags when reproducing a lane locally.
Discover tests by listing `tests/*.test.sh`: each is a self-contained bash script named `<subject>.test.sh`, and its header comment describes what it covers, so pass one to `bin/fm-test-run.sh` to focus on a subject with canonical timing output.
Tests that need a real optional backend or an explicit opt-in (real herdr/zellij/cmux smoke tests, the live Pi regression) skip themselves and print the tool or environment gate needed to enable them, so the portable suite remains safe on machines without those tools.
The [Herdr backend guide](docs/herdr-backend.md) owns the lane's safety and isolation rationale, including why live harness credential tests remain opt-in.
