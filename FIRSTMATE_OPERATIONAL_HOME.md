# Firstmate deferred instructions: operational-home

This agent-runtime bundle is the current conditional authority for the instructions below.
Load it deterministically with `bin/fm-instructions.sh operational-home` before the matching action.
The live block is rebuilt from the pinned upstream semantic baseline; superseded exact bytes are historical provenance and are not instruction authority.
See [prompt-disclosure verification](docs/verification/prompt-disclosure.md) and the upstream-reconciliation manifest for lineage and maintained checks.

<!-- Current authoritative upstream-derived block starts on the next line. -->
Tracked files hold shared instructions and tooling; `data/` holds durable private fleet records; `state/` holds runtime records and append-only status events; `config/` holds local operating choices; and `projects/` contains clones that are read-only to firstmate except under hard rule 1's concrete captain-approved project operation exception.

AGENTS.md            this file (CLAUDE.md is a real @AGENTS.md pointer to it)
CONTRIBUTING.md      contributor workflow and repo conventions
README.md            public overview and development notes
.github/workflows/   shared CI and PR enforcement, committed
.tasks.toml          tracked tasks-axi markdown backend config for the default backlog backend (section 10)
.agents/skills/      firstmate-loaded internal skills, committed; each carries metadata.internal=true for installers
.claude/skills       symlink to .agents/skills for claude compatibility
skills/              standalone public installer-facing skills, committed; not loaded by firstmate
bin/                 helper scripts, committed; read each script's header before first use
.env                 optional Relay pairing token; LOCAL, gitignored; presence-gates section 14
config/crew-harness  crewmate harness override; LOCAL, gitignored; absent or "default" = same as firstmate. Inherited as the literal file: a concrete primary adapter value also controls a secondmate home's own crewmates (section 4)
config/crew-dispatch.json  optional crewmate dispatch profiles; LOCAL, gitignored; firstmate-maintained but human-editable natural-language rules that choose a per-task harness/model/effort profile (section 4). Inherited by secondmate homes
config/secondmate-harness  harness the PRIMARY uses to launch SECONDMATE agents, optionally followed by a model and effort token on the same line ("<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]"; section 4); LOCAL, gitignored; absent or "default" harness falls back to config/crew-harness then firstmate's own. The primary's own setting; NOT inherited into secondmate homes (secondmates do not spawn secondmates)
config/backlog-backend  backlog backend override; LOCAL, gitignored; absent or "tasks-axi" = default tasks-axi backend, "manual" = force routine backlog updates to hand-editing; inherited by secondmate homes (section 10)
config/backend  runtime session-provider backend override for new tasks; LOCAL, gitignored; absent = falls through to runtime auto-detection (the runtime firstmate itself is executing inside), then tmux; tmux is the verified reference backend (docs/tmux-backend.md), while herdr, zellij, orca, and cmux are experimental spawn backends (docs/herdr-backend.md, docs/zellij-backend.md, docs/orca-backend.md, docs/cmux-backend.md) - herdr and cmux can also be selected by runtime auto-detection, zellij and orca never are (always explicit), and codex-app is not accepted; see docs/codex-app-backend.md; inherited by secondmate homes under the primary-authoritative contract in secondmate-provisioning
config/calm     Pi Calm presentation preference; LOCAL, gitignored, and not inherited; see docs/configuration.md "Pi Calm preference"
config/startup-memory-budget     primary-authoritative per-home startup-memory budget; LOCAL, gitignored, materialized as 7,500 estimated tokens by locked primary bootstrap and inherited into secondmate homes; see docs/configuration.md "Startup memory budget"
config/herdr-presentation-spaces  optional "off" opt-out from, or "on" opt-in to, Herdr's default-on disposable single-task visual projection, which is unconfigured-default-on only at or above a Herdr version floor; LOCAL, gitignored; inherited by secondmate homes; see docs/herdr-backend.md "Presentation spaces"
config/trace-context  optional presence flag enabling default-off native W3C trace-context propagation to spawned agents; LOCAL, gitignored; inherited by secondmate homes; see docs/configuration.md "Trace context propagation" and docs/trace-context.md
config/cmux-socket-password  optional cmux control-socket password; LOCAL, gitignored; read fresh on every cmux CLI call and passed through without ever overriding an operator's own ambient CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD when absent (docs/cmux-backend.md "Setup")
config/wedge-alarm  optional away-mode wedge-alarm active-alert directives; LOCAL, gitignored; absent means auto (macOS Notification Center when available); see docs/wedge-alarm.md
config/x-mode.env    generated Relay watcher cadence; LOCAL, gitignored; source before arming watcher when present
data/                personal fleet records; LOCAL, gitignored as a whole
  backlog.md         task queue, dependencies, history
  captain.md         this home's domain-local captain preferences and working style; LOCAL, gitignored, canonical even if harness memory mirrors it, and updated with inspect-then-update
  captain-shared.md  main-authoritative shared captain preferences propagated read-only to secondmate homes; LOCAL, gitignored, owned by secondmate-provisioning
  learnings.md       fleet-local operational facts and gotchas; LOCAL, gitignored; dated, evidence-backed, curated, and updated with inspect-then-update - rewrite and prune rather than append forever, the same contract as captain.md; created lazily, absent until this home has a learning to store
  projects.md        thin fleet navigation registry recording each project's standing delivery posture; firstmate-private, parsed for mechanical sync and seeding by fm-project-mode.sh (section 6)
  secondmates.md      local and remote secondmate routing table; firstmate-private, maintained by the secondmate seed helpers (section 6)
  <id>/brief.md      per-task crewmate brief, or per-secondmate charter brief when kind=secondmate
  <id>/report.md     scout task deliverable, written by the crewmate; survives teardown
projects/            cloned repos; gitignored; read-only except under hard rule 1's concrete captain-approved project operation exception
state/               runtime records and signals; gitignored
  <id>.status        appended by crewmates: "<state>: <note>" wake-event lines, not current-state truth
  <id>.turn-ended    touched by turn-end hooks
  <id>.grok-turnend-token   firstmate-owned grok hook registry token for the task; removed by teardown
  <id>.kimi-turnend-token   firstmate-owned Kimi hook registry token for the task; removed by teardown
  <id>.muse-session  muse busy-source binding (sessions root plus task worktree) written by fm-spawn; removed by teardown
  <id>.cursor-session  cursor busy-source binding (projects root, task worktree, prior conversations) written by fm-spawn; removed by teardown
  <id>.meta          task metadata; each producer script's header owns its exact fields and mutation contract, with docs/configuration.md routing operator-facing backend and trace-context details
  <id>.herdr-presentation  quarantinable attempt and restart-binding journal for Herdr's optional visual projection; never task or endpoint authority; see docs/herdr-backend.md "Presentation spaces"
  <id>.check.sh      authenticated slow poll; the watcher dispatches validated PR data and the byte-identified Relay shim through trusted repository scripts, runs registered custom checks from hash-validated private snapshots, and rejects every other state check without execution
  <id>.check-trust   private content binding created by fm-check-register.sh for an intentional custom check
  <id>.pr-poll       private validated data sidecar for the byte-static PR merge poll
  <id>.pr-poll-registration  private transactional provenance record binding the task, canonical metadata identity, sidecar, and static poll publication
  <id>.pr-poll-retirement  private identity-bound crash-recovery receipt for one exact validated merged result; removed after its poll artifacts retire
  .pr-check-quarantine/  private non-runnable storage for checks neutralized by the non-executing migration
  .pr-check-migration.log  private per-task outcomes distinguishing rebuilt or canonically registered replacement polls, quarantined unarmed polls, and incomplete migrations

  x-watch.check.sh   generated Relay poll shim; present only when opted in (section 14)
  pending-replies/   parent-owned secondmate pending-reply records (correlation id, delivery vs reply, recovery, escalation); fm-pending-reply-lib.sh
  procevent/         registered process-to-event sources, one private record per canonical source id; written only by bin/fm-procevent.sh, and their presence alone keeps supervision required (section 13)
  procevent-inbox/   private captured results and their durable handled-acknowledgement markers; source output lives here and never in an event line
  decision-bindings/ private bindings from a captured-answer source id to the captain-hold origin its keyed answers close; written only by bin/fm-decision-hold.sh bind, dropped by unbind and by source retirement (section 13; docs/decision-hold-lifecycle.md)
  when/              private condition->action watch specs, their trust bindings, and single-fire markers; written only by bin/fm-procevent-when.sh (section 13's process-event-sources trigger)
  x-inbox/           generated Relay pending mention payloads; fmx-respond drains it (section 14)
  x-context/         generated Relay durable per-request reply context and one-wake offer markers, keyed by request_id; survives inbox cleanup and expires within seven days (section 14; bin/fm-x-lib.sh)
  x-outbox/          generated Relay dry-run reply and dismiss previews; inspect it when FMX_DRY_RUN is set (section 14)
  public-followup/   generated private transport for promised public replies: commitment registrations, typed terminal-result inbox, accepted/rejected ledgers (section 14; bin/fm-public-followup.sh)
  x-poll.error x-poll.claim-error  generated Relay and offer-claim diagnostic dedupe markers
  .startup-network.*  status, report, per-step elapsed timings, inline-print claim, and lock for the deferred network stage session start runs off its blocking path; bin/fm-startup-network.sh
  .wake-queue        durable queued wakes retained until post-handling acknowledgement: epoch<TAB>seq<TAB>kind<TAB>key<TAB>payload
  .watcher-down      private generation-bound recovery state coupling watcher downtime, durable wake presentation, and post-handling acknowledgement; never touch
  .<id>.open-decisions-cursor  per-task byte cursor and folded open-decision set bounding the OPEN DECISIONS scan's cost to new status-log appends; written only by fm-classify-lib.sh's status_open_decisions_incremental, removed by teardown, safe to delete (forces one full re-fold)
  .status-presentation-cursor .status-presentation-lock  fleet-wide per-task status identity/byte-offset manifest and serialization lock preventing already-presented status lines from being replayed as new; owned by fm-classify-lib.sh, with each task's row retired by teardown
  .afk               durable away-mode flag; present = sub-supervisor may inject escalations (set by /afk, cleared on user return)
  .watch.lock .wake-queue.lock watcher singleton and queue serialization locks
  .claude-autoarm.lock .claude-autoarm-epoch .claude-autoarm-failure-notified .claude-autoarm-failure-alarmed .turnend-claude-blocks .turnend-claude-blocks.lock   Claude Stop auto-arm single-flight, epoch, failure-episode, attended-alarm, guard-budget, and budget-lock records; never touch
  .cursor-park-owner .cursor-park-owner.lock .turnend-cursor-blocks   Cursor stop-hook owner record, publication and commit lock, and bounded repair-nag budget; never touch
  .hash-* .count-* .stale-* .stale-since-* .paused-* .wedge-escalations-* .seen-* .hb-surfaced-* .last-* .heartbeat-streak   watcher internals; never touch
  .watch-triage.log  watcher's absorbed-wake debug log (size-capped); never relied on, safe to delete
  .last-watcher-beat watcher liveness beacon, touched every poll (including while absorbing benign wakes); guard scripts read it
  .subsuper-* .supervise-daemon.*   sub-supervisor internals; never touch
.no-mistakes/        local validation state and evidence; gitignored
