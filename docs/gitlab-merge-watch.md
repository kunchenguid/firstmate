# GitLab merge request watch verification

Maintainer verification for the merge watch on GitLab, alongside the existing GitHub watch.
The fixture CLI transcripts were captured on 2026-07-21, while the current validated observation contract is exercised by `tests/fm-pr-check-security.test.sh`.

## Versions

```
$ glab --version
Current glab version: 1.53.0

$ bash --version | head -1
GNU bash, version 5.3.9(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
```

## The evidence project

All live evidence here reads <https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture>, a public project that exists only to be this evidence.
It holds one deliberately merged merge request and one deliberately open one, so both outcomes can be shown against real data.
Every command against it reads a public merge request and needs no credential, so a reader can rerun each one and see the same output.
Its README asks that the open merge request be left open.

A non-default host appears below only as the placeholder `gitlab.example`, which resolves nowhere.
That is deliberate: the host-agnostic property is a property of the stored record and the poll's URL reconstruction, so it is demonstrated by inspecting those rather than by reaching any private instance.

## Why the host is data rather than a constant

GitLab runs mostly on self-hosted instances, so a merge request can live under any host.
A GitLab project also sits under at least one group at no fixed depth, so no owner-and-repository pair can address one the way it can on GitHub.
The stored record therefore carries `provider`, `url`, `host`, `path`, and `number`, and every consumer rebuilds the URL from those parts and refuses any record that does not reconstruct the stored URL exactly.
`tests/fm-pr-check-security.test.sh` asserts that neither `bin/fm-pr-lib.sh` nor `bin/fm-pr-poll.sh` contains the string `gitlab.com` at all.

## How glab is invoked, and why

`glab` cannot take a merge request URL the way `gh pr view` can.
That form shells out to git for the current repository, and the watcher runs in no repository:

```
$ cd /tmp && glab mr view https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
git: exit status 128
```

Passing the project URL to `-R` with the merge request number works from anywhere and resolves the instance from that URL rather than from glab's configured default:

```
$ cd /tmp && glab mr view 1 -R https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture
title:	Add the merged example file
state:	merged
author:	KarotKris
labels:	
assignees:	
reviewers:	
comments:	0
number:	1
url:	https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
--
This merge request is the merged half of the fixture. It is merged on purpose, so that reading its state returns merged.

$ cd /tmp && glab mr view 2 -R https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture | sed -n 's/^state:[[:space:]]*//p'
open
```

## End to end: arming and polling a real merge request

Three tasks were armed, two against the fixture and one against the placeholder host:

```
$ fm-pr-check.sh e1 https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
armed: state/e1.check.sh
$ fm-pr-check.sh e2 https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/2
armed: state/e2.check.sh
$ fm-pr-check.sh e3 https://gitlab.example/group/subgroup/project/-/merge_requests/7
armed: state/e3.check.sh
```

The stored record for each, showing the host and the full project namespace as data:

```
$ cat state/e1.pr-poll
gitlab
https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
gitlab.com
KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture
1

$ cat state/e3.pr-poll
gitlab
https://gitlab.example/group/subgroup/project/-/merge_requests/7
gitlab.example
group/subgroup/project
7
```

The provenance record for the non-default host, showing the bumped version tag:

```
$ cat state/e3.pr-poll-registration
fm-pr-poll-registration-v2
e3
gitlab
https://gitlab.example/group/subgroup/project/-/merge_requests/7
gitlab.example
group/subgroup/project
7
514b7e04f0cca3e2c913c9fd504c54dfe54c8a51a7f5ebc57279bbd4db5d4a60
1817b0f95db7148246434a4afa0b2c8e7b81fd8f74ef7d473bbd62023e47c439
70:957243
70:957244
```

The watcher uses the authenticated observation interface:

```
$ fm-pr-poll.sh --observe-validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/e1.pr-poll)
observed|merged|<head-sha>|<pipeline-status>|<pipeline-status>
```

The poll requests `glab mr view --output json` and parses the top-level merge request state, head SHA, and head-pipeline status with Perl's core `JSON::PP` module.
It validates those fields before emitting one `observed|state|head|checks|conclusion` record, and any CLI, JSON, schema, or validation failure remains silent.
The watcher compares that durable observation with prior evidence, surfaces only first readiness or a meaningful state, head, or check transition, and retires the poll only after an exact merged observation has been durably queued.
The legacy `--validated` and sidecar interfaces still emit only `merged` for compatibility:

```
$ fm-pr-poll.sh --validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/e1.pr-poll)
merged
$ fm-pr-poll.sh --validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/e2.pr-poll)
```

The same bytes work in the sidecar-driven compatibility mode, where the published check locates its own record:

```
$ state/e1x.check.sh
merged
```

## A missing CLI produces no wake, never a false merge

The poll is silent on every error by design, so a missing `glab` would otherwise be indistinguishable from a merge request that is never merged.
With `glab` removed from `PATH`, the poll stays silent even for the merge request that is genuinely merged:

```
$ PATH="$noglab" fm-pr-poll.sh --validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/e1.pr-poll)
$ PATH="$noglab" fm-pr-poll.sh --validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/e3.pr-poll)
```

Arming is the one point where that can be reported, so it refuses there instead of arming a watch that can never fire:

```
$ PATH="$noglab" fm-pr-check.sh e5 https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
error: watching a GitLab merge request requires glab on PATH
$ echo $?
1
```

A GitHub task is unaffected by a missing `glab`:

```
$ PATH="$noglab" fm-pr-check.sh e6 https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/pull/750
armed: state/e6.check.sh
```

## Upgrade path from an existing armed watch

The stored record gained the provider tag, so its version moved to `fm-pr-poll-registration-v2` and a record written by the previous release no longer parses.
The existing non-executing migration handles that: it never runs the old artifact, and rebuilds the poll from the task's recorded pull request URL.
Starting from a poll armed exactly as the previous release wrote it:

```
$ head -1 state/t1.pr-poll-registration
fm-pr-poll-registration-v1
$ fm-pr-check-migrate.sh --checks-safe
PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: canonical polls rebuilt and armed; resume supervision for this home
$ head -2 state/t1.pr-poll-registration
fm-pr-poll-registration-v2
t1
$ cat state/.pr-check-migration.log
task t1: migration outcome tracking started before legacy poll handling
task t1: canonical legacy poll rebuilt and armed
```

The rebuilt poll works, verified against a pull request that is genuinely merged:

```
$ fm-pr-poll.sh --validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/t1.pr-poll)
merged
```

No armed watch is lost by upgrading.

## What this change does not cover

`bin/fm-pr-merge.sh` still addresses GitHub only, by owner and repository.
It refuses a GitLab merge request URL rather than sending it to the wrong forge, so merging a merge request stays a deliberate manual step until merge parity lands separately.

The authenticated observation records the GitLab head SHA and pipeline status beside the task, so changed heads and red checks participate in the same one-shot notification lifecycle as GitHub evidence.
The arming metadata can still omit `pr_head=` when the initial head lookup is unavailable; later validated observations supply the durable polling evidence.
