# GitLab merge request watch verification

Empirical record for the merge watch on GitLab, alongside the existing GitHub watch.
Every command below was run on 2026-07-21 and its output is reproduced exactly.

## Versions

```
$ glab --version
Current glab version: 1.53.0

$ bash --version | head -1
GNU bash, version 5.3.9(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
```

## The evidence project

All live evidence here reads <https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture>, a public project that exists only to be this evidence.
It holds one deliberately merged merge request and one deliberately open one, so both outcomes can be shown against real data.
Every command against it reads a public merge request and needs no credential, so a reader can rerun each one and see the same output.
Its README asks that the open merge request be left open.

The host-agnostic property is covered by the canonical URL parser and security tests rather than by an unreachable live instance.

## Why the host is data rather than a constant

GitLab runs mostly on self-hosted instances, so a merge request can live under any host.
A GitLab project also sits under at least one group at no fixed depth, so no owner-and-repository pair can address one the way it can on GitHub.
The stored record therefore carries `provider`, `url`, `host`, `path`, and `number`, and every consumer rebuilds the URL from those parts and refuses any record that does not reconstruct the stored URL exactly.
`tests/fm-pr-check-security.test.sh` asserts that neither `bin/fm-pr-lib.sh` nor `bin/fm-pr-poll.sh` contains the string `gitlab.com` at all.

## Current provider snapshot contract

Firstmate requests one `glab` JSON provider observation and reads its top-level `sha`, `title`, and `description` fields.
When a task declares delivery rules, that same snapshot supplies the title and description used to validate the PR before registration.
The GitLab JSON parser uses the universal `node` toolchain documented in [configuration.md](configuration.md).
The head is accepted only when it is an exact commit hash, so a changed output format produces no registration rather than an unbound delivery record.
`tests/fm-pr-check-security.test.sh` verifies this contract hermetically through registration behavior, including distinct top-level and nested heads and a changed title in the same JSON snapshot.

## How plain glab is invoked, and why

The dated live transcript below establishes two separate plain `glab` facts used by that implementation.

First, plain `glab` has no field selector.
`gh` reads one field with `--json state -q .state`; `glab mr view` offers only `-F, --output string  Format output as: text, json`.

Second, `glab` cannot take a merge request URL the way `gh pr view` can.
That form shells out to git for the current repository, and the watcher runs in no repository:

```
$ cd /tmp && glab mr view https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
git: exit status 128
```

Passing the project URL to `-R` with the merge request number works from anywhere, and resolves the instance from that URL rather than from glab's configured default:

```
$ cd /tmp && glab mr view 1 -R https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture
title:	Add the merged example file
state:	merged
author:	KarotKris
labels:	
assignees:	
reviewers:	
comments:	0
number:	1
url:	https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
--
This merge request is the merged half of the fixture. It is merged on purpose, so that reading its state returns merged.

$ cd /tmp && glab mr view 2 -R https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture | sed -n 's/^state:[[:space:]]*//p'
open
```

## End to end: arming and polling a real merge request

Two tasks were armed against the fixture:

```
$ fm-pr-check.sh e1 https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
armed: state/e1.check.sh
$ fm-pr-check.sh e2 https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/2
armed: state/e2.check.sh
```

The stored record for each, showing the host and the full project namespace as data:

```
$ cat state/e1.pr-poll
gitlab
https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
gitlab.com
KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture
1

$ cat state/e2.pr-poll
gitlab
https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/2
gitlab.com
KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture
2
```

Running each published poll the way the watcher does, where an empty result means the poll stayed silent and produced no wake:

```
$ fm-pr-poll.sh --validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/e1.pr-poll)
merged
$ fm-pr-poll.sh --validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/e2.pr-poll)
```

The merged fixture merge request produces exactly one `merged` line.
The open one produces nothing rather than a false merge.

The same bytes work in the watcher's sidecar-driven mode, where the published check locates its own record:

```
$ state/e1x.check.sh
merged
```

## A missing CLI produces no wake, never a false merge

The poll is silent on every error by design, so a missing `glab` would otherwise be indistinguishable from a merge request that is never merged.
With `glab` removed from `PATH`, the poll stays silent even for the merge request that is genuinely merged:

```
$ PATH="$noglab" fm-pr-poll.sh --validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/e1.pr-poll)
```

Arming is the one point where that can be reported, so it refuses there instead of arming a watch that can never fire:

```
$ PATH="$noglab" fm-pr-check.sh e5 https://gitlab.com/KarotKris/gitlab-merge-watch-fixture/-/merge_requests/1
error: watching a GitLab merge request requires glab on PATH
$ echo $?
1
```

A GitHub task is unaffected by a missing `glab`:

```
$ PATH="$noglab" fm-pr-check.sh e6 https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/pull/750
armed: state/e6.check.sh
```

## Upgrade path from an existing armed watch

The stored record gained the provider tag and now requires a valid provider-observed head, so its version moved to `fm-pr-poll-registration-v2` and a record written by the previous release no longer parses.
The existing non-executing migration never runs the old artifact.
It revalidates each task through the current delivery-field seam, rebuilds only records that pass from the task's recorded pull request URL, and quarantines records with missing, stale, or rejected provider data without publishing a replacement poll.
Starting from a poll armed exactly as the previous release wrote it:

```
$ head -1 state/t1.pr-poll-registration
fm-pr-poll-registration-v1
$ fm-pr-check-migrate.sh --checks-safe
PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: canonical polls rebuilt and armed; resume supervision for this home
$ head -2 state/t1.pr-poll-registration
fm-pr-poll-registration-v2
t1
$ cat state/.pr-check-migration.log
task t1: migration outcome tracking started before legacy poll handling
task t1: canonical legacy poll rebuilt and armed
```

The rebuilt poll works, verified against a pull request that is genuinely merged:

```
$ fm-pr-poll.sh --validated $(tr '\n' ' ' < state/t1.pr-poll)
merged
```

A canonical validated watch remains armed by upgrading, while rejected or stale records are quarantined without publishing monitoring.

## What this change does not cover

`bin/fm-pr-merge.sh` still addresses GitHub only, by owner and repository.
It refuses a GitLab merge request URL rather than sending it to the wrong forge, so merging a merge request stays a deliberate manual step until merge parity lands separately.

A GitLab task records `pr_head=` from the merge request's JSON `sha` field, and registration refuses when `glab` cannot provide a valid head.
`bin/fm-teardown.sh` reads the current head from the provider and requires it to equal the registered head before accepting landed delivery.
`bin/fm-review-diff.sh` still resolves the head from the remote when reviewing legacy metadata that has no recorded head.
