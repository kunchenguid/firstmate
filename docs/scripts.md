# The bin/ toolbelt

The first mate drives these; interactive entrypoints work by hand too, while `*-lib.sh` files are sourced helpers.
The table is a selective task-facing reference, not an exhaustive inventory of `bin/`: it lists the scripts you choose between during work, so a script with no row is not missing or deprecated.
Each row is one purpose clause only: the script's own header comment is the authoritative description of its behavior, flags, and contracts, so read the header before first use, and list `bin/` itself when you need every script.
If you have changed away from the firstmate home in an interactive shell, invoke these scripts by absolute path through the repo's `bin/` directory; the scripts self-locate internally after they start.
The shared no-mistakes gate refusal for fleet lifecycle entrypoints is summarized in [architecture.md](architecture.md#no-mistakes-gate-authority-boundary), while `docs/sessionstart-nudge.md` covers the silent session-open hook use; `fm-gate-refuse-lib.sh`'s header owns its exact contract.
