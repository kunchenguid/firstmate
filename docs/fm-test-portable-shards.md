# Firstmate portable test shards

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` owns portable lane composition and execution.
`bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh` owns the proven-isolated candidate set.

## Verification inputs

The current candidate timings came from the 2026-08-20 concurrent proof recorded in [fm-test-isolation-proof.md](fm-test-isolation-proof.md).
The proof ran 24 candidates with four workers and no failures.

## Parallel lanes

The two parallel lanes use longest-processing-time assignment from those measured durations.

| Lane | Script count | Estimated duration |
|---|---:|---:|
| `portable-parallel-1` | 11 | 134295 ms (~134.3 s) |
| `portable-parallel-2` | 13 | 126020 ms (~126.0 s) |
| imbalance | | 8275 ms |

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` contains the exact ordered memberships in `list_portable_parallel_1` and `list_portable_parallel_2`.

## Portable serial remainder

`portable-serial` includes every `tests/*.test.sh` that is neither proven-isolated nor `real-herdr-gated`.
It keeps watcher, lock, AFK, real tmux, daemon, secondmate lifecycle, bootstrap, live-harness opt-in, GUI-backend, and other unproven work serial.
Membership is derived rather than enumerated, so a newly added test lands here by default.

## Portable serial CI shards

On green CI run [30725985757](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/30725985757), that remainder accumulated 19m04s of script time against a 20-minute job timeout.
On [PR 1495](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/pull/1495), its main step ran about 19m51s before the job was cancelled at that boundary.
`portable-serial-<k>of<n>` splits it across `n` separate CI runners.
Each shard is still strictly serial in itself, and separate runners mean no two of these stateful scripts ever share a machine, so the split needs no concurrency isolation proof.

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` owns `n` and refuses any lane whose `of<n>` disagrees with it.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` derives the same `n` from `strategy.job-total` rather than a literal, so changing the shard count in either file without the other fails the lane loudly instead of leaving part of the required suite unrun.

Assignment is longest-processing-time bin packing over per-script duration hints embedded in `bin/fm-test-run.sh`.
The 139 current hints are the slowest measurements retained from the `fm-test-timing-portable-serial-*` artifacts of three green CI runs on 2026-09-01, [33558082172](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/33558082172), [33523597838](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/33523597838), and [33463326167](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/33463326167).
Those per-script maxima total 3825047 ms of conservative balance weight.
Taking the slowest of several runs rather than a single run keeps the balance honest on a slow runner: individual scripts varied by up to 20% between those three runs.
A script with no hint gets the conservative `PORTABLE_SERIAL_DEFAULT_WEIGHT_MS` default; the current 140-script lane has one such script, bringing its assignment weight to 3852047 ms.
Hints only affect balance: the coverage guard keeps the partition complete and disjoint whatever they say, so a stale hint costs a slower shard rather than lost coverage.
Balance is still worth keeping current, because enough unmeasured scripts let one shard carry more than twice another shard's real work and reach the job cap while another runner sits idle.
That is not hypothetical: by 2026-09-01 the lane had grown from 116 to 139 scripts and from ~42 to ~63 minutes, 17 scripts were still unmeasured, and several hints were low by 2-5x, so shard 3 of 4 ran 17-20 minutes against its 20-minute cap while shard 1 ran 11.5 minutes and run [33574154856](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/33574154856) timed out seconds after a passing test.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage` now reports the unmeasured share as `serial_unhinted=` and refuses past `PORTABLE_SERIAL_MAX_UNHINTED_PERCENT`, so hint drift fails the coverage guard instead of silently pushing one shard into its job cap.
Refresh the hints whenever the serial lane gains scripts, rather than waiting for that bound to trip.

| Lane | Script count | Estimated duration |
|---|---:|---:|
| `portable-serial-1of5` | 27 | 770410 ms (~12.84 min) |
| `portable-serial-2of5` | 29 | 770416 ms (~12.84 min) |
| `portable-serial-3of5` | 30 | 770417 ms (~12.84 min) |
| `portable-serial-4of5` | 26 | 770405 ms (~12.84 min) |
| `portable-serial-5of5` | 28 | 770399 ms (~12.84 min) |
| imbalance | | 18 ms |

The current table is generated from the runner's retained maxima plus its default for the one unhinted script.
The last complete replay against the three source runs put the then-current partition's worst shard at 12.54 min, 63% of the 20-minute job cap.

The single longest script, `tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh` at 262626 ms, is the floor for any shard count.

Refresh the hints by downloading the per-shard timing artifacts from several green CI runs, replacing the `portable_serial_weight_hints` table in `bin/fm-test-run.sh` with the slowest measured `duration_ms` per `path`, and updating the table above:

```sh
for run in <run-id> <run-id> <run-id>; do
  gh run download "$run" -R kunchenguid/firstmate --pattern 'fm-test-timing-portable-serial-*' -D "/tmp/fm-serial/$run"
done
jq -r '.scripts[] | [.path, .duration_ms] | @tsv' /tmp/fm-serial/*/*.json \
  | awk -F'\t' '$2 > m[$1] { m[$1] = $2 } END { for (p in m) print p, m[p] }' \
  | LC_ALL=C sort
bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage
```

A timed-out shard uploads no artifact, so pick runs where every serial shard is green or the lane's slowest scripts go unmeasured in exactly the shard that needs them most.

## Coverage guard

`bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage` verifies that both parallel lanes partition the proven-isolated set.
It also verifies that the parallel lanes, portable serial lane, and real-Herdr family are disjoint and cover every `tests/*.test.sh` script.
It separately verifies that the portable serial CI shards are non-empty, disjoint, and together equal the portable serial lane.
It reports the unmeasured serial share as `serial_unhinted=` and refuses when that share exceeds `PORTABLE_SERIAL_MAX_UNHINTED_PERCENT`, so the shards stay balanced on evidence rather than on the default weight.

## Timing artifacts

Portable shards, each portable serial shard, and the Herdr lane upload runner-generated timing JSON.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --aggregate-json` creates the combined summary artifact.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the exact artifact names and aggregation wiring.

## Local entry points

[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) owns the local test policy and common entry points.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --help` owns exact lane names, selection flags, and bounded `--jobs` mechanics.

## Timeouts

| Lane | Bound | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| portable parallel 1/2 | job `timeout-minutes: 10` | The measured shard sums are about three minutes and the timeout is a hang tripwire. |
| portable serial 1-5 | job `timeout-minutes: 20` | Each balanced shard carries about 12.84 minutes of conservative assignment weight, leaving roughly 1.6x hang-tripwire margin for job setup and runner-speed spread. |
| Herdr | family-run step `timeout-minutes: 20`; job `timeout-minutes: 75` backstop | The step bound is the hang tripwire (cleanup and timing artifacts still upload) while the job cap stays a last-resort backstop. Refresh this figure from the lane's uploaded timing artifact. |

Timeouts are hang tripwires rather than expected healthy durations.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the exact numbers.
