# Watcher continuity

The watcher remains intentionally one-shot: one actionable reason closes one watcher cycle.
Must-work continuity now lives above that process boundary instead of depending on the model remembering a re-arm step.

## Ownership

Pi's `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` owns continuous re-arm after an actionable child close.
The extension starts the next arm before delivering the wake prompt, checks current session-lock ownership at launch, preserves one child or scheduled retry at a time, and applies bounded exponential retry after an unexpected or failed close.
A failed follow-up never cancels continuity restoration.
Pi submits each internal watcher wake directly through `pi.sendUserMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })`; Feishu state never intercepts or schedules watcher input.
Pi same-process session replacement follows the generation-owner contract in `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts`: an owning `session_start` arms the replacement generation without waiting for a model turn, and a state-scoped replacement handoff carries every actionable close whose delivery overlapped `session_shutdown`, including a main follow-up Pi accepted but had not yet consumed, branch handling, and a retiring child that reports after the bounded shutdown wait.
A main follow-up counts as delivered once Pi accepts it, never once the model reads it, because a follow-up queued while main is streaming joins the running run without a `before_agent_start`; the extension header owns how consumption is observed and why it only decides what a replacement replays.
## Actionable wake ordering

After an actionable Pi child close, the adapter starts and verifies one singleton successor before it delivers the original wake.
It confirms the handling handoff against that successor before scheduling the follow-up, retries once against the current generation and successor, and treats a failed confirmation as a restoration failure: it classifies the error, retires a successor that is no longer alive, and surfaces exactly one typed message.
A failed confirmation is never swallowed.
It waits at most one readiness timeout per attempt, then sends TERM and waits a bounded retirement confirmation before the next lock-verified exponential retry.
If the unready arm does not retire within that bound, the adapter keeps ownership, starts no overlapping retry, and delivers the typed fallback immediately.
When that retained arm later closes, its actual close is classified as a new supervised event without replaying the earlier fallback.
After the configured retry bound is exhausted, it delivers the original wake with a typed continuity-restoration failure even if every successor arm hung without reporting readiness.
This is deliberate Option B ordering: the fleet is protected before the model handles the wake whenever restoration succeeds, but the model is never left blind when it does not.

Codex retains its bounded foreground checkpoint protocol.
The shared turn-end guard remains the final supervision backstop.

## Recovery episode acknowledgement

A recovery episode is one generation of `state/.watcher-down`, and it is retired only by the generation-bound acknowledgement the drain prints as `WAKE_ACK_REQUIRED`.
An unacknowledged downtime generation is announced at most once: the first recovery marks that generation announced, and later arms wait until a new down stretch mints a new generation.
A non-successor watcher start after an announced-but-unacked episode is a new down stretch and mints a fresh generation so buried decisions still resurface once.
Every watcher close and every durable queue append publishes downtime, so a downtime republication of any pending episode reuses its generation instead of minting a new one, and an already-announced generation stays announced.
That reuse keeps a watcher close inside the handling window from orphaning the acknowledgement already presented and trapping later arms in repeated recovery presentation.
An acknowledgement carries two separable facts: queue-row consumption is bound to the monotonic `--ack-through` sequence (further scoped per actor - see "Per-actor acknowledgement" below), while only retiring the episode is bound to `--recovery-generation`.
A generation mismatch therefore does not block consumption of rows through that sequence; it is a non-fatal result that names its own remedy - re-drain, then acknowledge the newer episode.
The acknowledgement retires the marker only when no rows remain after sequence-bound consumption.
A concurrently appended wake has a higher sequence, remains queued, and keeps the episode pending for presentation.
Consequently, an empty-queue downtime publication during handling can be retired by the outstanding acknowledgement without a dedicated recovery turn.
An acknowledged episode does not freeze the generation, because the next downtime after it opens an episode of its own.

## Per-actor acknowledgement

`bin/fm-wake-drain.sh` consumes the queue per actor, not per whole-queue cutoff, using `bin/fm-lease-lib.sh`'s existing `fm_lease_actor` identity (`FM_SUPERVISION_ACTOR`, unset or `main` for every non-Pi harness and Pi's own main session; `branch` only inside the Pi supervision branch's own bash tool calls, injected deterministically by the extension - never agent memory).
Every presented row is claimed to exactly one actor under the durable queue lock.
An ordinary presentation drain bounds both its initial queue-lock acquire and its later status-presentation-lock acquire at the deadline owned by the script header.
A live initial queue-lock holder produces one PID-naming advisory and skips the whole drain before any claim or mutation, while a live status-presentation-lock holder produces one such advisory after raw wake presentation and leaves status annotations, sections, and cursors retriable on the next drain.
Acknowledgement invocations and every other mutation-critical queue-lock acquire retain blocking semantics, so acknowledgement atomicity is unchanged.
Main records its presented set in `state/.main-eligible-rows`.
A branch grant is published through `bin/fm-wake-grant.sh` under that same lock in `state/.branch-eligible-rows`, bound to the live branch process and extension generation recorded in `state/.branch-eligible-owner`, and publication is refused if main already claimed any requested row.
Synchronous acceptance transfers delivery into the branch settlement while carrying the watcher's exact sequence-to-task admission snapshot.
The existing pending-actionable records and replacement claims retain unsettled deliveries independently, so a long branch settlement cannot block a later MAIN-only wake.
Successor restoration stays serialized, and a verified successor failure retains its bounded retry until outstanding deliveries settle.
Before publishing the grant after asynchronous queueing, the branch rechecks generation, selection revision, lock ownership, trigger disposition, every admitted sequence, and each resolved task identity; a changed or retired identity rejects settlement to watcher fallback without prompting.
Acceptance therefore proves immediate branch eligibility and capacity to own the settlement, while the later grant proves the exact rows are still safe to execute.
A busy branch instead reports an offered wake whose eligible rows its live grant already covers as already owned, and the watcher suppresses that main delivery because the in-flight turn's drain will present those rows; rows outside the live grant keep the single main fallback.
A main drain validates that owner evidence under the queue lock and reclaims the grant when its process is gone or its identity no longer matches.
A main drain claims every currently unclaimed row and excludes an active branch grant from both presentation and acknowledgement.
Because that exclusion makes those rows invisible to main, `bin/fm-guard.sh`'s queued-wake warning counts only the rows the calling actor can itself present or retire, so an actor is never sent to a drain that provably has nothing for it.
`bin/fm-wake-lib.sh` owns that per-actor count (`fm_wake_actor_pending_count`) alongside the grant row-list and owner-record reads that the drain and `bin/fm-wake-grant.sh` share.
A row a live grant reserves is therefore never counted as drainable for main; rather than going silent about a visibly non-empty queue, the guard prints a distinct advisory naming the live supervision branch as the holder and saying not to drain those rows from here.
The branch actor's queued-wake output stays suppressed in every case.
A main drain with nothing of its own left, and a live grant still holding the queue, says so in one bounded line instead of exiting silently.
A row that lost the five appended fields or its numeric sequence can never be claimed, presented, or named by an `--ack-through` cutoff, so a main drain retires it under the queue lock and reports how many it removed together with those rows verbatim, bounded to the first 20 and a count of the rest, because the queue was their only durable record; a branch drain never does, because a grant can only name sequences that were structurally valid when it was published.
A retirement that cannot be read or written is reported and never fails the drain: the rows that remain usable are still presented with their acknowledgement command, the unusable ones stay queued for a later drain to retire, and failing the whole drain would strand the usable rows too.
Its `--ack-through <SEQ>` deletes only claimed main rows at or below the cutoff, while a branch acknowledgement deletes only claimed branch rows at or below its cutoff.
Every settled branch prompt releases any residual grant, so an omitted or failed acknowledgement leaves the durable row available to a later main drain; a successful acknowledgement has already removed it.
An acknowledgement whose cutoff removes none of the actor's rows while a presented row above the cutoff still waits is reported as having acknowledged nothing, together with the exact `--ack-through` and `--recovery-generation` command for that presented row; the presented set is read before any re-claim, so a row that arrived after presentation is never named for unseen acknowledgement.
If a branch offer loses the claim race to main, it rejects its settlement so the watcher retains the actionable close until Pi accepts its main follow-up.
[`pi-supervision-branch.md`](pi-supervision-branch.md#components-and-their-owners) owns branch eligibility, mixed-queue dispatch, the pre-drain recheck, and heartbeat's all-or-nothing rule.
A check-kind row is main-owned in every mode, including a heartbeat review, so it is never part of a branch claim and never defers one; main is woken for it on that check's own triggering close.
`fm-wake-drain.sh` never reclassifies a row itself: it filters the queue to the current actor's opaque claim before same-key deduplication, then presents and acknowledges only that actor-local view.
A missing or empty branch snapshot is refused loudly rather than read as "nothing eligible", because reaching the drain without the non-empty handoff promised by the extension is a wiring bug.
Because branch claims contain no check-kind rows, a branch acknowledgement skips check-specific receipt scans.
`tests/fm-wake-queue.test.sh`'s mixed-queue actor, stale-acknowledgement remedy, and presentation-deadline tests drive the real scripts: branch acknowledgement cannot swallow a main row, a concurrent main turn cannot present or acknowledge an active branch grant, a no-op stale acknowledgement names the current presented wake's exact command, live-holder presentation contention stays bounded and retriable, and acknowledgement locking remains blocking.
The same suite pins the counted-equals-presentable invariant against `bin/fm-guard.sh` and `bin/fm-wake-drain.sh` together: a branch-held row raises the held advisory rather than the ordinary queued-wake warning for main, and is presented with its acknowledgement command - with the ordinary warning restored - as soon as the grant clears, and structurally unusable rows are retired by main alone while every remaining row stays presentable and acknowledgeable.
`tests/fm-pi-branch-extension.test.sh` pins extension-side classification, claim publication and release, and the pre-drain recheck.
`tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` drives the retained old-task plus live-task counterexample through the real watcher classifier: the old row reaches main, the unrelated live row is offered once with its exact identity snapshot, and both durable rows remain unchanged until their owning actor drains them.

The watcher and branch also write a bounded, privacy-safe causal trace to `state/.supervision-routing.jsonl`; [Pi supervision branch](pi-supervision-branch.md#routing-diagnostics) owns its fields, retention, redaction, and explicitly non-authoritative role.

## Arm-layer cycle contract

`bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` never returns a clean empty success.
An actionable child output returns that reason normally.
A zero/empty child return rechecks the home lock and beacon, attaches to a verified healthy successor when one exists, or resolves the close against the watcher's bounded terminal-delivery ledger.
An attached arm follows verified identity-matched successors and resolves the same way when that chain ends without one, because it holds no handle on the watcher's stdout and cannot read the reason line itself.
Before releasing its singleton lock after printing an actionable reason, the watcher records that reason with its PID and process identity in `state/.watch-deliveries.log`.
A matching PID and identity lets an attached arm report the delivered reason and exit zero even after its durable wake was handled and acknowledged, while an unrelated queue producer or a recycled PID cannot satisfy the match.
Only a cycle with no matching delivery record emits `watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason` and exits nonzero.

The arm layer appends one tab-separated record per observed cycle to `state/.watch-cycle-exits.log`.
Each record includes arm and watcher PIDs, start and end timestamps, exit code and signal, classified reason, beacon age, lock identity before and after close, and successor disposition.
The file is size-capped through `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` and `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_KEEP_LINES`.
`state/.watch-triage.log` remains only the watcher's bounded absorbed-wake debug log and carries no lifecycle semantics.

The default 300-second grace is unchanged.
Only the watcher process touches `state/.last-watcher-beat`; no helper process can make a wedged watcher appear healthy.

## Regression coverage

`tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` checks Pi's first-cycle-or-explicit-repair tool metadata and ownership-based redundant-call no-ops, then simulates actionable and empty child closes against the actual Pi close handler, blocks prompt delivery to prove the successor launches first, verifies single-flight behavior, changes the session lock before close to prove ownership is rechecked, and hangs each successor arm to prove bounded fallback delivery includes the typed restoration failure.
The same suite covers ordinary same-process session replacement for `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, and reload, same-instance shutdown-plus-start, automatic re-arm before any model turn, a fresh extension-module rebind carrying all in-flight actionable closes exactly once, stale prior-generation callbacks, repeated transitions with exactly one live cycle, disappearance of the shutting-down refusal after a valid replacement activates, and terminal quit still refusing late rearm.
`tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` covers durable queue replay, real remote parent-replies ingestion into the authoritative status log, decision-only OPEN DECISIONS recovery, interrupted handling replay, generation-bound acknowledgement, a persistent live successor after recovery, a watcher close inside the handling window that must leave the printed acknowledgement valid, and the self-healing moved-generation acknowledgement that consumes its handled rows and names its remedy.
`tests/fm-watch-recovery-loop.test.sh` covers the once-per-generation announcement bound with the real Pi extension against a refused handling handshake, and a handling successor that must surface a real crew event instead of going blind.
`tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh` covers verified-successor attach, recovery publication before stale-lock removal, the typed self-eviction failure, bounded and successor-linked lifecycle rows, and a SIGSTOP counterfactual that distinguishes a live PID from a stale beacon before classifying termination.
## Active limits and verification

The goal is continuity without a Pi model-memory re-arm step.
No zero-latency guarantee is claimed because lock verification, watcher startup, and bounded retry delays remain deliberate safety work.
Codex retains bounded foreground checkpoints.

[`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#watcher-continuity) records the retained harness verification commands.
