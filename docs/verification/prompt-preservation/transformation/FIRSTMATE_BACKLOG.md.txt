# Firstmate deferred instructions: backlog

This agent-runtime bundle is the single conditional owner of the preserved instructions below.
Load it deterministically with `bin/fm-instructions.sh backlog` before the matching action.
The preserved block is copied verbatim from `AGENTS.md` at baseline `a218ebc497af996e04f2aa8d4b8dbd569d4b882a`.
See [prompt-disclosure verification](docs/verification/prompt-disclosure.md) for provenance, measurements, and maintained checks.

<!-- Verbatim preserved baseline block starts on the next line. -->
`data/backlog.md` is the durable queue.
It tracks work items only, never agents; persistent secondmates never appear as backlog items.
Work routed to a secondmate is recorded in that secondmate home's own backlog, not the main backlog.
When a main-side thread such as a pending captain decision or relay reminder is worth durable tracking, file it as its own work item; use `tasks-axi hold <id> --reason "<reason>" --kind captain` for a captain-gated thread.
Unresolved decisions discovered by investigations or visual reviews follow `decision-hold-lifecycle`, which owns their mandatory backlog lifecycle.
Update the backlog on every dispatch, completion, and decision for a work item.
Re-evaluate queued work after every teardown and heartbeat, dispatching items only when dependencies and time gates have cleared.

`.tasks.toml`, `docs/configuration.md`, and current `tasks-axi --help` own the backlog schema, compatibility, retention, and routine command syntax.
Use compatible `tasks-axi` when the configured backend selects it and the documented manual path otherwise; keep only the configured recent Done entries.
`secondmate-provisioning` and `bin/fm-backlog-handoff.sh` own cross-home handoff safety.

Keep free-form notes free of temporary paths, moving versions, ephemeral identifiers, and copied state that will rot.
Inspect the current task note before replacing its considered body, and archive the superseded body when recoverability matters rather than appending by default.
Verify volatile details against their authoritative config, live system, or API before acting, and correct or delete stale prose immediately.
Preserve durable structured identifiers, dependencies, and completion artifact links, and route reusable knowledge to section 6 rather than scattering it through task notes.
