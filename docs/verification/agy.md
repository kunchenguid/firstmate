# Verification: the agy (Antigravity CLI) crewmate/scout adapter

Active empirical facts for firstmate's agy adapter.
The skill tree rooted at [`.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`](../../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md) owns the operating facts through [`references/harness/agy.md`](../../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/references/harness/agy.md); this record owns how they were established and what is still unproven.

## Subject

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | `agy 1.2.0` |
| Verified | 2026-09-10 |
| Binary | `/home/andpod/.local/bin/agy`, an ELF 64-bit Go-compiled single executable |
| Platform | Linux x64 (Arch, kernel 7.2.3) |
| Backend | Herdr, in an isolated non-`default` lab session (`fm-lab-firstmate-agy-ad-*` via `bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh`); the live `default` session was unchanged throughout |

Every command below ran inside the disposable firstmate task worktree or the named Herdr lab session.
No captain fleet state was touched.

## Detection: ancestry only, no marker

```
$ agy --version
1.2.0
```

A live TUI's `/proc/<pid>/environ` carries no `AGY_*` or `ANTIGRAVITY_*` variable.
It does carry `AGENT=1` and `CLAUDECODE=1`, both inherited from the launching environment, so neither is an agy identity and neither is promoted to a marker.
Herdr's `pane process-info` for the same pane reports the foreground process as `name=agy` with `argv=["agy", ...]`, and `ps -o comm=` reports `agy`.
`bin/fm-harness.sh` therefore matches the anchored process name `agy` alone, and the spawn clears `CLAUDECODE`, `PI_CODING_AGENT`, `GROK_AGENT`, and `FM_PI_HARNESS` at the launch boundary.
`tests/fm-agy-harness.test.sh` pins the anchored match, the rejection of unrelated names containing the fragment, and that an inherited `CLAUDECODE` never outranks a real `agy` ancestor once the spawn clears it.

## Launch: positional prompt-interactive with auto-submit

```
$ agy --prompt-interactive "Reply with exactly AGY_LIVE_PROBE_OK and nothing else" --model gemini-3.8-flash-low --effort low --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

The brief submitted itself with no extra Enter, the turn ran, and the reply rendered in the pane.
A second launch into the same directory answered a fresh prompt the same way, so the shape is repeatable, not a first-run accident.
The footer rendered `Gemini 3.8 Flash · low`, proving both flags were accepted together.

## Trust dialog: safe default, answered at inspection

A first launch in a fresh worktree shows this dialog:

```
Accessing workspace:

/home/andpod/.treehouse/firstmate-7bab20/1/firstmate/agy-probe-tmp

Do you trust the contents of this project?

Antigravity CLI requires permission to read, edit, and execute files here.

> Yes, I trust this folder
  No, exit
```
Two supervised Herdr runs in treehouse worktrees completed file-writing turns while the dialog was still unanswered at observation time (worker file and `done:` status line both verified on disk before Enter was ever sent to those panes).
Isolated runs in untrusted `/tmp` directories never reached the workspace until Enter: the turn spun through exploratory tool calls in agy's own scratch directory instead, and only the queued prompt ran after the answer.
The mechanism behind the difference was not established; path, backend, and latency were all varied across runs without isolating a single cause.
The operating rule does not depend on it: answer the dialog with a single Enter at inspection in all cases, verify the turn through artifacts and the registry rather than the dialog, and never steer into an unanswered dialog.
Answer promptly: one run left unanswered for several minutes wrote its file to agy's scratch directory instead of the workspace once finally answered, so a long-stalled untrusted pane that misdirects should be relaunched rather than steered.
Answering appended the worktree to `trustedWorkspaces` in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`, which firstmate never writes.
Reused paths show no dialog.

## Model and effort

```
$ agy models
Fetching available models...
gemini-3.8-flash-high	Gemini 3.8 Flash (High)
gemini-3.8-flash-medium	Gemini 3.8 Flash (Medium)
gemini-3.8-flash-low	Gemini 3.8 Flash (Low)
...
```

`agy --help` documents `--effort` as `low|medium|high` and `--model` as the model for the session.
The bare `gemini-3.8-flash` id from this home's previous config is not listed; only the suffixed `-high`, `-medium`, and `-low` variants are.
`bin/fm-spawn.sh`'s `agy_model_validate` refuses a requested id a reachable `agy models` listing omits, and launches unvalidated when the listing is unreachable.
Print mode (`agy -p "Reply with exactly: AGY_PRINT_PROBE_OK" --model gemini-3.8-flash-low`) returned the exact reply with exit 0 in about 8 seconds, proving the credential path without a pane.

## Busy state: two rendered signals, unknown on absence

Mid-turn the pane rendered both signals at once:

```
⣯  Generating...
└ Tip: When reviewing a file edit, press f to see the full diff.
...
esc to cancel                                                           Gemini 3.8 Flash · low
```

The completed turn showed the reply, then the idle composer:

```
>
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
? for shortcuts                                                         Gemini 3.8 Flash · low
```

`fm_busy_agy_tail_busy` matches `esc to cancel` or `Generating...`, so losing either signal keeps the busy verdict.
`fm_busy_classify` reports `unknown agy-regex` when neither matches, because a long turn can scroll the marker out of the captured tail.
Herdr's own registry agreed throughout: `agent get` reported `agent_status=working` mid-turn and `idle` after, so on Herdr the native verdict carries busy with no new code.

## Interrupt and exit

A single `Escape` sent mid-turn through `herdr pane send-keys` cancelled it and printed this row, with the composer back at idle and no repolluted text:

```
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Antigravity CLI do instead?
```

Sending `/quit` plus Enter exited the process; the pane closed under the `exec` launch, and Herdr reported the pane gone.
`bin/fm-control-lib.sh` records `Escape` once, no clear key, no ack source, and `/quit` for agy.

## Backend liveness: Herdr recognizes agy, tmux names it

```
$ herdr agent get w2:p1 --session fm-lab-firstmate-agy-ad-1599574-8823
{"result":{"agent":{"agent":"agy","agent_status":"idle",...,"agent_session":{"agent":"agy","kind":"id","source":"herdr:antigravity_cli",...}}}}
```

Herdr tracks agy natively (`antigravity-cli` integration, detected as `agent=agy`), so `fm_backend_herdr_pane_agent_state` returns `live` for every registered agy status and no exit-detection hardening was needed.
`bin/backends/tmux.sh` matches the anchored process name `agy` as `agent`, the muse/omp precedent for short bare-word names.
agy stays out of the session-lock name vocabulary in `bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh`, where the other crewmate-only adapters are also absent.

## Composer: unknown by design

Byte-level capture of the idle pane shows a bare unstyled `>` between two full-width `─` rules, with an unstyled `? for shortcuts` cell and a dim (`SGR 2`) model cell in the status row below.
The shared classifier reads that bare `>` as `unknown` under the dead-shell rule, never `empty`.
Steering still confirms delivery: the Herdr submit core leads with the native `idle`-to-`working` transition, which agy performs, and the delivery footer regex covers the tmux path.
This is the cursor precedent, not a gap to patch in shared code.

## Supervised task: spawn, steer, relaunch, and exit through the new path

A trivial scout ran end to end through `bin/fm-spawn.sh --harness agy` against the same isolated lab session: `spawned agy-e2e1 harness=agy kind=scout` with a treehouse-provisioned worktree, `--model gemini-3.8-flash-low`, and `--effort low` all recorded in task metadata.
The worker wrote its worktree file and appended `done: agy e2e turn complete` to its status file, which lives outside the worktree, proving prompt processing, tool execution, outside-workspace file access, and a new completion event.
Durable steering held: a `bin/fm-send.sh` message landed in the task inbox, the worker appended the steered lines to both files, and its inbox record moved to `handled/`.
Same-copy relaunch held: `bin/fm-control.sh relaunch --note` replaced the worker in place on the identical worktree, model, and effort, the replacement verified both prior lines intact and appended `relaunched: done`.
Exit held: `bin/fm-control.sh exit` stopped the worker, the registry returned `agent_not_found`, and the pane remained a lone shell in the worktree with all work intact.
No automatic quota failover was exercised or claimed; every handoff above was an explicit supervised relaunch.

## What is still unproven

The unauthenticated failure mode was never observed; this host's agy runs signed in, so any auth prompt is a fail-loud credential blocker, not a handled dialog.
No slash-skill invocation form was verified, so skill invocation stays natural language.
`--continue` and `--conversation` resume were never exercised; recovery uses deterministic relaunch from the brief on disk.
No primary or secondmate behavior was built or tested, and none is claimed.

## Refreshing this record

Run the portable suite and the live guard after any agy upgrade, because the process name, marker set, trust dialog, and rendered busy/interrupt text are all vendor-controlled surfaces:
