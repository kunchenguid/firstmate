# Supervision integration verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

This record supports current session-start, turn-end, watcher-continuity, and wedge-alarm guarantees.
Operator behavior and active limits remain in the linked current guides.
Task-specific chronology, temporary paths, run identifiers, and delivery transcripts remain in private reports or PR evidence.

## Native session-start delivery

The cross-harness transport pass ran on 2026-07-17 with Codex 0.144.4, Grok 0.2.103, OpenCode 1.17.18, Pi 0.80.10, and the tracked Claude hook wiring.

Codex command shape:

```sh
codex exec --ephemeral --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --output-last-message last.txt \
  'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.'
```

Observed result: the `SessionStart` hook completed and its stdout reached model context.

Grok command shape:

```sh
grok --trust -p 'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.' \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain
```

Observed result: the project hook ran, but its stdout did not reach model context.
This is the current Grok fail-open limit.

OpenCode was checked in both headless and interactive modes.
`client.session.promptAsync` accepted the nudge in both cases; the persistent TUI completed the generated turn, while `opencode run` exited before another turn.
This is the current headless fail-open limit.

Pi command shape:

```sh
pi -p -e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts \
  --no-context-files --no-session \
  'After obeying any earlier session-start instruction, reply with exactly PI_SMOKE_DONE.'
```

Observed result: `PI_SMOKE_DONE`, with one session-start execution.
The earlier `sendUserMessage` counterfactual raced the positional prompt; the current non-triggering `pi.sendMessage` custom message did not.
The installed pi-signed 0.82.0 wrapper repeated the Pi primary extension and session-start path on 2026-07-27.
[`runtime-backends.md`](runtime-backends.md#tmux) owns the shared-ancestry evidence and authoritative selection-marker boundary.

### Run-tier source vocabulary and context-reset injection

The run tier depends on three facts only the vendor can supply: the session-open source it reports, whether hook stdout reaches model context on a context-RESET open rather than only a cold one, and whether a worker the hook detaches survives the hook returning.
The first two were measured on 2026-08-05 against a throwaway Firstmate-shaped lab carrying each harness's own tracked registration with a recorder standing in for `bin/fm-sessionstart-run.sh`.
Each open printed a source-stamped token, and the model was asked to quote that token back, so producing hook stdout could never be mistaken for delivering it.
The third is recorded below.

| Harness | Version verified | Cold open | Context reset | Context-preserving reopen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | 2.1.222 (Claude Code) | `source=startup`, token quoted back in both `-p` and the TUI | `/clear` reports `source=clear` and `/compact` reports `source=compact`; both re-injected a fresh token that the model quoted back | `claude --continue` reports `source=resume` |
| Codex | codex-cli 0.146.0 | `source=startup` under `codex exec`, token quoted back | Not reachable from a tracked project registration; see the limit below | `codex exec resume --last` reports `source=resume` |
| Pi | 0.82.0 | `source=startup`, token quoted back in both `-p` and the TUI | `/new` raises `session_start` reason `new`, which the extension maps to `clear`; `/compact` raises `session_compact`, and both freshly injected source-stamped tokens were quoted back | `pi -c` reports reason `startup`, not `resume` |

Two harness-specific consequences are load-bearing rather than incidental.

Codex's interactive TUI fired no project `SessionStart` hook at all in the same lab where `codex exec` fired it reliably, which matches the earlier 2026-07-28 finding for 0.145.0.
Codex's run tier is therefore verified only for `codex exec`.
The interactive TUI remains on the tracked nudge floor through `AGENTS.md` and the Ahoy fallback; Firstmate ships no global hook and does not depend on one.

Pi compaction was verified on 2026-08-05 with Pi 0.82.0 in the same throwaway lab after setting `.pi/settings.json` `compaction.keepRecentTokens` to 200 and completing one substantial assistant-prose turn before issuing `/compact`.
Pi reported `Compacted from 7,697 tokens`, the recorder observed `session_compact`, and the model quoted the freshly injected `source=compact` token back.
Both preconditions are load-bearing: the stock 20,000-token keep window exceeds a small lab session, and `AgentSession.compact()` aborts an in-flight turn before measuring compactable history, which otherwise discards that turn and reports `Nothing to compact (session too small)`.
Tool output alone does not grow compactable context; the completed assistant prose does.

Observed compaction output and recorder source:

```text
Compacted from 7,697 tokens
compact
```

Pi disagrees with Claude and Codex on `resume`: a NEW Pi process continuing a session reports `startup`, and Pi's `resume` reason is reserved for an in-process session switch.
That is correct for the run tier rather than a problem, because a new process holds no lock and must take the helm; the routing table in [`../sessionstart-nudge.md`](../sessionstart-nudge.md#source-routing) is written to whichever source each harness actually reports.

### Detached session-open workers survive the hook

Session start composes its digest from local reads and runs every external-network call in a worker detached by the hook (`bin/fm-startup-network.sh`), so a harness that reaped the hook's process tree would silently stop running the sweeps rather than merely delaying them.
Verified on 2026-08-06 with Claude Code 2.1.222 in a throwaway lab whose `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh` sleeps 6s before writing a marker, so the marker can exist only if the worker outlived the hook and the whole `claude -p` process.

```text
$ claude -p --permission-mode bypassPermissions '<quote the session-start token>'
FMHOOKTOKEN-startup-1-abc123
--- claude exited at 13:38:40; polling for the detached worker's marker ---
MARKER at +4s: detached worker survived the hook
state=done
started=1786048716
finished=1786048723
```

The worker started before the harness exited and published 6s after it was gone.

The latency this buys was re-measured on 2026-08-06 against default-branch tip `8398d31`, in a throwaway home holding one remote secondmate whose host hangs 25s per SSH connection (an `FM_SSH_BIN`-shaped stub; no real host was contacted).
Both runs used the same fixture and the same `bin/fm-session-start.sh` invocation, differing only in which checkout supplied the script:

```text
before (8398d31)   real 1m21.15s   3 blocking SSH attempts inside the digest
after              real 0m3.36s    digest prints IN PROGRESS; the same 3 SSH attempts
                                   run in the detached worker and finish at +77s
```

The remaining seconds are entirely local subprocess work; the `NETWORK CHECKS` section named GitHub authentication, dead-secondmate relaunch, secondmate convergence, pending handoff delivery, and project clone refresh as not yet confirmed.

Deferring the sweeps changed only when they run, not what they conclude.
The deferred worker's published report was byte-identical to the three sweep lines the blocking baseline printed, on the same fixture:

```text
SECONDMATE_LIVENESS: secondmate ios: skipped: remote host unavailable or endpoint state unknown; route preserved on remote-mac
SECONDMATE_SYNC: secondmate ios: skipped: remote tracked-file sync failed on remote-mac:
SECONDMATE_SYNC: secondmate ios: skipped: remote inheritance failed on remote-mac:
```

The unreachable route was preserved rather than relaunched in both runs, and the result surfaced durably as a queued `check: startup-network` wake once the worker finished.

Codex and Pi were not installed as run-tier labs in this measurement, so their evidence for this fact is NOT refreshed; `tests/fm-sessionstart-hook-live-e2e.test.sh` asserts it for every installed run-tier harness and is the command that refreshes this record.
A harness that did reap the worker degrades loudly rather than silently: the leftover record reads as an abandoned run needing a rerun, and the next session start re-derives every finding, because these sweeps are idempotent detectors.

Current deterministic and live entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh
tests/fm-session-start.test.sh
tests/fm-startup-network.test.sh
FM_SESSIONSTART_HOOK_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-sessionstart-hook-live-e2e.test.sh
FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
```

`tests/fm-sessionstart-hook-live-e2e.test.sh` is the command that refreshes the table above; run it after every run-tier harness upgrade.
It reports an absent harness explicitly, asserts Pi compaction rather than noting it, and refuses to pass when no run-tier harness was installed at all.

The Ahoy first-message boundary was reverified on 2026-07-22 with Pi 0.81.1 and OpenCode 1.17.18.
Marked current operational input and the two exact legacy compatibility shapes selected Bearings, while genuine near-miss captain messages remained real boundaries.
The detailed reconciliation and task chronology stay in the private audit report and PR evidence.

## Semantic busy state

The per-adapter semantic sources behind [`bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`](../../bin/fm-busy-lib.sh) were live-verified on 2026-07-28 against firstmate-launched workers wired exactly as `fm-spawn` writes them.
Each pass polled `state/<id>.busy-state` while a real turn ran.

| Harness | Version verified | Semantic source | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | 0.82.0 | Extension `agent_start` / `agent_settled` with `ctx.isIdle()` | The spawn seed `busy source=fm-spawn`, then `busy source=pi-ext event=agent-start`, then `idle source=pi-ext event=agent-settled`; the turn-end marker was still touched. |
| OpenCode | 1.17.18 | Plugin `session.status` | In a real TUI pane: seed, then `busy source=opencode-plugin event=session-busy`, then `idle source=opencode-plugin event=session-status-idle`. |
| Claude | 2.1.220 (Claude Code) | Hooks `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`, `SessionEnd` | `UserPromptSubmit` fired for the argv launch prompt and each steer, and `Stop` closed every completed turn. A mid-stream Escape interrupt fired no closing hook, which is why the firstmate-controlled clear exists. `StopFailure` and `SessionEnd` are wired from the four hook names present in the installed binary; only the abnormal paths they cover were not reproduced live. |
| Codex | codex-cli 0.145.0 | None usable | See below; classifies `unknown codex-unverified`. |
| Kimi (standalone) | not installed | None usable | No binary on `PATH`, so the gate stays closed and it classifies `unknown kimi-unverified`. |
| Grok | 0.2.112 | Isolated rendered-tail fallback | Retained unconverted; the approved audit could not credit a live structured-lifecycle run. |

Codex was probed two ways, both refused:

```sh
codex app-server daemon start
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust 'Reply with exactly PROBE2.'
```

The daemon refused with `managed standalone Codex install not found`, and an interactive TUI worker neither starts nor attaches to the app-server control socket, so no client can observe its turns.
In this 2026-07-28 Codex 0.145.0 semantic-busy probe, Firstmate-written lifecycle project hooks under `<worktree>/.codex/hooks.json` fired for neither an interactive pane whose directory trust was granted nor `codex exec`, in both cases with `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`, while an untracked global probe fired in the same runs; Firstmate does not ship, install, recommend, or depend on that global path.
Codex also exposes no `StopFailure` hook, so an API-error turn end would need separate coverage even after hook discovery works.
The app-server protocol schema does define the required lifecycle (`turn/started`, plus a `turn/completed` status of `completed`, `interrupted`, `failed`, or `inProgress`), so the gate is a reachability problem rather than a protocol gap.

Deterministic entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-busy-state.test.sh
tests/fm-busy-adapter-wiring.test.sh
tests/fm-crew-state.test.sh
```

## Turn-end guard

The direct and passive mechanisms were validated across all five harnesses on 2026-07-08 through 2026-07-12, with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24.

| Harness | Version verified | Mechanism | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | 2.1.219 | Cooperative blocking `Stop` guard plus `asyncRewake` auto-arm | A fresh unsupervised session ran session start first, reclaimed a stale dead-owner lock, completed two tokenless rewake cycles with no model arm command or guard continuation, and left a competing live owner unchanged. |
| Codex | 0.142.1 | Blocking `Stop` hook | Hook process root stayed anchored to the trusted checkout and one continuation ran. |
| OpenCode | 1.17.6 | Passive `session.idle` callback | Throwing could not block, while `promptAsync` scheduled one TUI follow-up; headless remained fail-open. |
| Pi | 0.80.5 | Passive `agent_settled` callback | Exactly one guard follow-up ran for an unhealthy cycle, with no recursion across tool turns. |
| Grok | 0.2.112 native and 0.2.73 pre-native | Running-payload adaptive `Stop` | Native false-to-true continuation stayed in one process with two model turns and zero resume launches; the field-absent pre-native process launched exactly one guarded resume. |

The Grok adaptive matrix ran on 2026-07-28 with separate scratch repositories and homes, dedicated tmux sockets, one target plus one control window, ambient tmux variables removed, and a socket-bound wrapper first in `PATH`.

```sh
FM_GROK_STOP_LIVE_E2E=1 \
  FM_GROK_NATIVE_BIN="$native_grok_0_2_112" \
  FM_GROK_LEGACY_BIN="$official_pre_native_grok_0_2_73" \
  tests/fm-grok-stop-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed bounded output:

```text
ok - grok 0.2.112 (9bbd559437aa) [stable] native Stop kept one session across false->true, two model turns, and zero resume processes
ok - grok 0.2.73 (9ff14c43bbe5) [stable] legacy Stop omitted capability, resumed exactly once, and stopped normally
ok - Grok adaptive Stop real-process matrix passed with exact target cleanup and control-window survival
```

The same run proved the Claude-compatible Stop entries stay inert under `GROK_AGENT`, the legacy resume carries `GROK_TURNEND_GUARD_ACTIVE=1`, and every replacement root is removed after exact target cleanup while its control window survives.
That inertness result is scoped to the builds it exercised: it did not establish that `GROK_AGENT` reaches a Grok HOOK process, and on grok 1.0.0 it does not, so the marker set was widened to `GROK_HOOK_EVENT` as well (docs/turnend-guard.md "Harness integrations").
`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` now pins every tracked `.claude/settings.json` hook entry against a real grok 1.0.0 hook environment so the inertness contract is covered deterministically rather than only by the opt-in live matrix.

The secondmate-home scope and manual-repair wake path were measured with Claude Code 2.1.207 on 2026-07-12, when a native background completion re-invoked the idle model with no human input.
The current Stop-owned main/secondmate inclusion and child-worktree exclusion are covered deterministically by `tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh`.
Session-lock ownership in `bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh` is decided against a session's whole contiguous harness ancestry rather than one chosen pid, so the Stop auto-arm reaches its lock owner wherever that owner sits: the outermost pid of Claude Code's multi-level `bg-spare` hook worker chain, or an inner pid when a harness-named daemon parents the session.
Harness identity is read from the executable path and `argv[0]` as well as the command basename, because Claude Code's native installer names the per-session executable by its version (`.../share/claude/versions/2.1.220`): `ps -o comm=` reports that path on macOS and the bare version string on Linux, and neither basename names a harness.
`tests/fm-session-lock-ancestry.test.sh` pins both platforms' reporting semantics behind a deterministic process table and runs the real Stop auto-arm in version-named, daemon-parented, and combined real process trees.
`tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` runs a real watcher and attached arm to verify that a delivered reason survives queue draining, while an unrelated queue append cannot make a watcher cycle that delivered nothing look successful.

The Claude product live path ran with Claude Code 2.1.219 on 2026-07-24:

```sh
claude --version
FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
2.1.219 (Claude Code)
ok - Claude 2.1.219 (Claude Code) live E2E reclaimed a stale session lock through session start, completed two tokenless Stop-owned rewake cycles, and preserved the competing-live-owner boundary
```

```

The Claude auto-arm false-failure, guard-predicate, and monotonic bounded fail-open correction was verified on 2026-08-02 with the installed ShellCheck 0.11.0 and isolated behavior suites.

```sh
bin/fm-lint.sh

```

The model-aware pull-guard predicate correction (`bin/fm-guard.sh` no longer reports a false watcher-down mid-turn under the Claude Stop auto-arm model, where the watcher runs only between turns) was verified on 2026-08-04 with the installed ShellCheck 0.11.0 and the same isolated behavior suites.

```sh
bin/fm-lint.sh
bin/fm-doc-audience-check.sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh tests/fm-guard-stale-banner.test.sh tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh tests/fm-supervision-instructions.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text

fm-doc-audience-check: ok surfaces=64 local_links=188
FM_TEST_SUMMARY total=4 failed=0 skipped_gate=0 duration_ms=80078
```

The broader relevant regression pass was rerun on 2026-08-02 without live-home or daemon mutation.

```sh

```

Observed output:

```text
FM_TEST_SUMMARY total=8 failed=0 skipped_gate=0 duration_ms=617507
```

The actionable-close ordering correction was reverified on 2026-08-02 against an identity-matched live successor.

```sh
tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh >/dev/null && echo "fm-claude-stop-autoarm: ok"
```

Observed output:

```text
fm-claude-stop-autoarm: ok
```

## Watcher continuity

The cross-harness evidence combines the 2026-07-17 live pass with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24, all against isolated project and home state.
No credential material was copied into a fixture.

```text
Claude Code 2.1.219
codex-cli 0.144.4
OpenCode 1.17.18
Pi 0.80.10
grok 0.2.103 (89c3d36fb6f1) [stable]
```

| Harness | Exact opt-in command | Observed guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | `FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh` | Session start reclaimed a stale owner before two Stop-owned cycles, and a competing live owner prevented arm, rewake, epoch write, or lock replacement. |
| Codex | `FM_CODEX_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-codex-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | The one-second foreground checkpoint returned without switching to the arm wrapper. |
| OpenCode | `FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | A verified successor existed before prompt handling, with no model re-arm or turn-end fallback. |
| Pi | `FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | One initial tool call led to extension-owned successors and clean child retirement on exit. |
| Grok | `FM_GROK_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-grok-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | Native task completion surfaced the actionable close and the cycle ledger recorded `reason=actionable-signal`. |

Pi 0.81.1 repeated the continuity and clean-exit lifecycle on 2026-07-23 after the Calm presentation changes.

Pi same-process session-transition ownership was verified on 2026-07-27 against the tracked extension with a faithful in-process factory rebind (module cache retained, real arm children):

```sh
pi --version
tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: after ordinary `session_shutdown` for `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork`, plus same-instance shutdown-plus-start, the replacement generation armed again without a Pi restart and without the `watcher: not armed - Pi session is shutting down` refusal.
Stale prior-generation tool callbacks could not mutate the active child, repeated transitions kept exactly one live arm cycle, and terminal `quit` still refused late rearm.
Plain Pi and pi-signed share the same tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` path, so both inherit the generation owner; other primary harnesses are not applicable because they do not use this Pi extension lifecycle.

## Wedge-alarm channels

The two real notification channels were bounded manually on 2026-07-10 on macOS 26.5.2 with Herdr 0.7.3.
Automated suites never execute these real notification commands.

Argv-safe Notification Center command:

```sh
/usr/bin/osascript \
  -e 'on run argv' \
  -e 'display notification (item 1 of argv) with title "FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE" sound name "Basso"' \
  -e 'end run' \
  'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)'
```

Observed output: no stdout, exit 0, and one banner with the supplied body.

Herdr command:

```sh
herdr notification show 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE' \
  --body 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)' \
  --sound request
```

Observed output:

```json
{"id":"cli:notification:show","result":{"reason":"shown","shown":true,"type":"notification_show"}}
```

The safe command-channel contract is covered without a notification by `tests/fm-daemon.test.sh`: the summary reaches both `$1` and stdin, every channel is process-group bounded, and a failed channel falls through.
