# Orca runtime backend

Orca is an experimental macOS backend in which the Orca app owns both the task worktree and terminal endpoint.
The crewmate harness remains the agent process launched inside that endpoint.
Firstmate agents load [`firstmate-orca`](../.agents/skills/firstmate-orca/SKILL.md) before operating or recovering this backend.

## Setup

Pick Orca when you already use the Orca macOS app and want Orca-managed worktrees and terminals instead of Treehouse plus a session multiplexer.
Orca is macOS-only, explicit-only, and does not support secondmate spawns.

Prerequisites:

- `/Applications/Orca.app` installed, running, and ready.
- The `orca` CLI, installed with `brew install orca`.
- The universal harness and toolchain requirements in [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#toolchain).

Select Orca with local `config/backend` containing `orca`, `FM_BACKEND=orca` for one launch, or an explicit request to Firstmate.
It is never auto-detected.

Before any spawn mutates repository state, Firstmate requires `orca status --json` to report `reachable=true` and `state="ready"`.
The first task for a project registers that repository with `orca repo add --path` when needed.
No manual repository registration is required.

Open the Orca app to watch a task's terminal.
Routine supervision uses the recorded endpoint through `bin/fm-peek.sh <id>` and `FM_HOME=<home> bin/fm-send.sh <id> '<text>'`.
Enter and Ctrl-C are supported; Escape is not.

## Task shape and metadata

Each task has one Orca-managed git worktree and one Orca terminal.
`fm-spawn.sh` does not call Treehouse for Orca tasks.
The normal isolation and unlanded-work refusal rules still apply.

```text
backend=orca
window=fm-<id>
terminal=<orca terminal handle>
orca_worktree_id=<orca repo id>::<absolute worktree path>
worktree=<absolute Orca worktree path>
```

`window=` remains the caller-facing Firstmate alias.
`terminal=` and `orca_worktree_id=` are the backend authority used by cleanup, and by send while the recorded terminal handle is live.
A hand restart can replace the terminal handle while preserving `window=`, the Orca worktree name.
After Orca rejects a send or send-key because the recorded handle is stale or not writable, Firstmate retries through the native recorded-worktree name selector without editing metadata.
Resolution requires exactly one usable live pane in a non-truncated result; a missing or ambiguous window preserves the original failure and never falls back to a global terminal-title search.
Healthy handles keep the same command sequence, and unrelated failures do not trigger retargeting.
For an inbox steer, a failed doorbell leaves the durable record available for the watcher's re-ring policy in [`bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh).
[`bin/backends/orca.sh`](../bin/backends/orca.sh) owns the exact selector, rejection classification, and retry mechanics.
Orca returns `orca_worktree_id=` as that composite of the Orca repo id and the worktree path, and cleanup validation requires both halves rather than treating the value as a simple name.

## Current lifecycle and safety

Spawn registers the repository, creates an independent worktree, reuses only the verified `result.terminal.handle` returned by Orca or creates a terminal explicitly, installs harness hooks, records metadata, and launches the selected harness.
Exact command flags and response parsing are owned by `bin/backends/orca.sh` and script help.

`fm-peek.sh` reads with `orca terminal read`.
An ordinary metadata-routed `fm-send.sh` text steer becomes a durable steering-inbox record, and only its best-effort constant doorbell passes through Orca's submit machinery.
Replacement panes showing a blocking dialog refuse text and Enter; an explicit Ctrl-C remains available.
After resolving a replacement pane, an inbox ring defers if its composer is unreadable or unproven, holds other input, or shows delivery-busy state; a proven pending own doorbell is reused without appending another copy.
An empty replacement may receive the doorbell text, but never a bare inbox Enter.
Immediately before Enter on a replacement, including after the settle delay, the inbox gate requires the pane to still hold its own doorbell and refuses empty, foreign draft, busy, unreadable, or blocking-dialog states without pressing Enter.
Any inbox Enter on a replacement leaves the ring deferred and stops further Enter attempts in that send, even if the Enter was accepted.
The durable steer remains recorded; the watcher's retry-mark policy is owned by [`bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh).
Inbox rings on the original handle retain their two-Enter budget.
Duplicate retries are an accepted cost.
Draft and busy deferral applies to inbox rings; explicit typed text and Enter retain their existing semantics subject to the dialog guard and typed submission rule below.
On the typed plane, `fm-send.sh` verifies composer clearance through the fleet-wide classifier in `bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`, retrying Enter without retyping when a slash popup first fills an argument placeholder.
If typed submission Enter changes the endpoint from the one that received the literal text, verification stops without retyping or further Enter attempts; an empty replacement composer cannot confirm text typed elsewhere.
`fm-send.sh` exits 3 with an unconfirmed-submission message directing the caller to inspect the replacement before deciding whether to resend.
The composer read is one bounded tail of the live terminal and never pages backward into scrollback, so a stale startup banner cannot compete with the bottom-anchored composer.
A bare shell row is `unknown`, not an empty agent composer, and plain-text captures degrade a glyph row carrying trailing text to `unknown` rather than a false `pending`.
The watcher has no native Orca busy signal, so each harness adapter's semantic lifecycle supplies worker state.
Grok alone retains its isolated rendered-tail fallback.

Cleanup keeps all shared Firstmate safety checks.
A scout still requires its report and completed decision inventory.
A ship still refuses dirty or unlanded work.
Before release, cleanup resolves the recorded Orca worktree id and verifies its path matches the recorded worktree path.
A missing, unreadable, or mismatched identity preserves metadata and stops rather than deleting anything.
After those checks, Firstmate closes the exact terminal and releases the exact worktree with Orca's worktree command.
It never raw-deletes an Orca worktree.
A close the CLI never attempted, because `orca` is not on the path, stops cleanup with the metadata intact even under `--force`: removing those records would leave nothing on disk naming a terminal that may still be live.
Reinstall the CLI and rerun; [`verification/runtime-backends.md`](verification/runtime-backends.md) "Endpoint close" owns what this arm can and cannot prove about its own close.

## Active limits

- Orca is macOS-only and explicit-only.
- The app must be running and report ready.
- Secondmate spawns are unsupported.
- Escape is unsupported.
- Orca exposes no stable CLI version or protocol marker, so readiness is the compatibility gate rather than a version floor.
- Only the verified terminal-handle and worktree result fields are accepted; speculative response shapes are rejected.
- Orca's worktree shape is unverified against the spawn-time Claude workspace-trust check in `bin/fm-claude-trust.sh`, which refuses any path that is not a linked git worktree sharing the project's git common dir, so a claude spawn on Orca fails loudly at that check rather than launching if Orca clones instead of linking.
