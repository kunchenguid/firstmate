# Orca runtime backend

Orca is an experimental macOS backend in which the Orca app owns both the task worktree and terminal endpoint.
The crewmate harness remains the agent process launched inside that endpoint.
Firstmate agents load [`firstmate-orca`](../.agents/skills/firstmate-orca/SKILL.md) before operating or recovering this backend.

## Setup

Pick Orca when you already use the Orca macOS app and want Orca-managed worktrees and terminals instead of Treehouse plus a session multiplexer.
Orca is macOS-only, explicit-only, and does not support secondmate spawns.

Prerequisites:

- `/Applications/Orca.app` installed, running, and ready.
- The `orca` CLI, installed with `brew install orca`.
- The universal harness and toolchain requirements in [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#toolchain).

Select Orca with local `config/backend` containing `orca`, `FM_BACKEND=orca` for one launch, or an explicit request to Firstmate.
It is never auto-detected.

Before any spawn mutates repository state, Firstmate requires `orca status --json` to report `reachable=true` and `state="ready"`.
The first task for a project registers that repository with `orca repo add --path` when needed.
No manual repository registration is required.

Open the Orca app to watch a task's terminal.
Routine supervision uses the recorded endpoint through `bin/fm-peek.sh <id>` and `FM_HOME=<home> bin/fm-send.sh <id> '<text>'`.
Enter and Ctrl-C are supported; Escape is not.

## Task shape and metadata

Each task has one Orca-managed git worktree and one Orca terminal.
`fm-spawn.sh` does not call Treehouse for Orca tasks.
The normal isolation and unlanded-work refusal rules still apply.

```text
backend=orca
window=fm-<id>
terminal=<orca terminal handle>
orca_worktree_id=<orca repo id>::<absolute worktree path>
worktree=<absolute Orca worktree path>
```

`window=` remains the caller-facing Firstmate alias.
`terminal=` and `orca_worktree_id=` are the backend authority used by cleanup, and by send while the recorded terminal handle is live.
A send or send-key whose recorded handle is stale resolves the live pane from that `window=` alias at send time and does not rewrite the record.
Orca does not accept the alias as `--terminal`; the native selector is `orca terminal list --worktree name:<window>`, which must return exactly one live pane.
A window that cannot be resolved keeps today's failed send, including the doorbell refusal that names the recorded terminal and leaves the re-ring in place.
The mechanic is owned by `bin/backends/orca.sh`.
Orca returns `orca_worktree_id=` as that composite of the Orca repo id and the worktree path, and cleanup validation requires both halves rather than treating the value as a simple name.

Because a hand restart issues a fresh terminal handle while `window=` (the Orca worktree name) stays stable, a recorded `terminal=` can go stale and refuse every send.
The submit and send-key cores therefore re-resolve `window=` at send time through Orca's native `orca terminal list --worktree name:<window>` selector and deliver to the live handle Orca reports now.
Resolution is read-only against `state/<id>.meta` - producer-owned fields are never written - and runs only after Orca rejects a send with an endpoint-identity error, so a healthy terminal keeps its exact recorded command sequence and a rejected write can never duplicate text.
Whenever the window cannot be resolved, the recorded-handle failure surfaces unchanged: the steer stays durably recorded with the doorbell refusal, and the watcher's re-ring ladder owns delivery from there.
[`bin/backends/orca.sh`](../bin/backends/orca.sh) owns the exact mechanics.

## Current lifecycle and safety

Spawn registers the repository, creates an independent worktree, reuses only the verified `result.terminal.handle` returned by Orca or creates a terminal explicitly, installs harness hooks, records metadata, and launches the selected harness.
Exact command flags and response parsing are owned by `bin/backends/orca.sh` and script help.

`fm-peek.sh` reads with `orca terminal read`.
An ordinary metadata-routed `fm-send.sh` text steer becomes a durable steering-inbox record, and only its best-effort constant doorbell passes through Orca's submit machinery.
After resolving a replacement pane, an inbox ring defers if its composer is unreadable or unproven, holds other input, or shows delivery-busy state; a proven pending own doorbell is submitted without appending another copy.
On the typed plane, `fm-send.sh` verifies composer clearance through the fleet-wide classifier in `bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`, retrying Enter without retyping when a slash popup first fills an argument placeholder.
The composer read is one bounded tail of the live terminal and never pages backward into scrollback, so a stale startup banner cannot compete with the bottom-anchored composer.
A bare shell row is `unknown`, not an empty agent composer, and plain-text captures degrade a glyph row carrying trailing text to `unknown` rather than a false `pending`.
The watcher has no native Orca busy signal, so each harness adapter's semantic lifecycle supplies worker state.
Grok alone retains its isolated rendered-tail fallback.

Cleanup keeps all shared Firstmate safety checks.
A scout still requires its report and completed decision inventory.
A ship still refuses dirty or unlanded work.
Before release, cleanup resolves the recorded Orca worktree id and verifies its path matches the recorded worktree path.
A missing, unreadable, or mismatched identity preserves metadata and stops rather than deleting anything.
After those checks, Firstmate closes the exact terminal and releases the exact worktree with Orca's worktree command.
It never raw-deletes an Orca worktree.
A close the CLI never attempted, because `orca` is not on the path, stops cleanup with the metadata intact even under `--force`: removing those records would leave nothing on disk naming a terminal that may still be live.
Reinstall the CLI and rerun; [`verification/runtime-backends.md`](verification/runtime-backends.md) "Endpoint close" owns what this arm can and cannot prove about its own close.

## Active limits

- Orca is macOS-only and explicit-only.
- The app must be running and report ready.
- Secondmate spawns are unsupported.
- Escape is unsupported.
- Orca exposes no stable CLI version or protocol marker, so readiness is the compatibility gate rather than a version floor.
- Only the verified terminal-handle and worktree result fields are accepted; speculative response shapes are rejected.
- Orca's worktree shape is unverified against the spawn-time Claude workspace-trust check in `bin/fm-claude-trust.sh`, which refuses any path that is not a linked git worktree sharing the project's git common dir, so a claude spawn on Orca fails loudly at that check rather than launching if Orca clones instead of linking.
