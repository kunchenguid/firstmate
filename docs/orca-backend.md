# Orca runtime backend

Orca is an experimental macOS backend in which the Orca app owns both the task worktree and terminal endpoint.
The crewmate harness remains the agent process launched inside that endpoint.
Firstmate agents load [`firstmate-orca`](../.agents/skills/firstmate-orca/SKILL.md) before operating or recovering this backend.

## Setup

Pick Orca when you already use the Orca macOS app and want Orca-managed worktrees and terminals instead of Treehouse plus a session multiplexer.
Orca is macOS-only, explicit-only, and does not support secondmate spawns.

Prerequisites:

- `/Applications/Orca.app` installed, running, and ready.
- The `orca` CLI, installed with `brew install orca`.
- The universal harness and toolchain requirements in [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#toolchain).

Select Orca with local `config/backend` containing `orca`, `FM_BACKEND=orca` for one launch, or an explicit request to Firstmate.
It is never auto-detected.

Before any spawn mutates repository state, Firstmate requires `orca status --json` to report `reachable=true` and `state="ready"`.
The first task for a project registers that repository with `orca repo add --path` when needed.
No manual repository registration is required.

Open the Orca app to watch a task's terminal.
Routine supervision uses the recorded endpoint through `bin/fm-peek.sh <id>` and `FM_HOME=<home> bin/fm-send.sh <id> '<text>'`.
Enter and Ctrl-C are supported; Escape is not.

## Task shape and metadata

Each task has one Orca-managed git worktree and one Orca terminal.
`fm-spawn.sh` does not call Treehouse for Orca tasks.
The normal isolation and unlanded-work refusal rules still apply.

```text
backend=orca
window=fm-<id>
terminal=<orca terminal handle>
orca_worktree_id=<orca worktree id>
worktree=<absolute Orca worktree path>
```

`window=` remains the caller-facing Firstmate alias.
`terminal=` and `orca_worktree_id=` are the backend authority used by operation and cleanup paths.
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md#runtime-backend-configbackend--fm_backend) owns shared metadata semantics, including the `endpoint_task_id=` cleanup binding every task records.

## Current lifecycle and safety

Spawn registers the repository, creates an independent worktree, reuses only the verified `result.terminal.handle` returned by Orca or creates a terminal explicitly, installs harness hooks, records metadata, and launches the selected harness.
Exact command flags and response parsing are owned by `bin/backends/orca.sh` and script help.

`fm-peek.sh` reads with `orca terminal read`.
`fm-send.sh` types and verifies composer clearance, follows `oldestCursor` when Orca returns a limited page, and retries Enter without retyping when a slash popup first fills an argument placeholder.
A bare shell row is `unknown`, not an empty agent composer.
The watcher has no native Orca busy signal and uses the shared terminal-tail fallback.

Cleanup keeps all shared Firstmate safety checks.
A scout still requires its report and completed decision inventory.
A ship still refuses dirty or unlanded work.
Before release, cleanup resolves the recorded Orca worktree id and verifies its path matches the recorded worktree path.
A missing, unreadable, or mismatched identity preserves metadata and stops rather than deleting anything.
After those checks, Firstmate closes the exact terminal and releases the exact worktree with Orca's worktree command.
It never raw-deletes an Orca worktree.
When a launch aborts and the Orca worktree cannot be released, `fm-spawn.sh` records the task's metadata, including that cleanup binding, so `bin/fm-teardown.sh <id>` can still reclaim the leftover terminal and worktree instead of leaving an unowned one behind.

## Active limits

- Orca is macOS-only and explicit-only.
- The app must be running and report ready.
- Secondmate spawns are unsupported.
- Escape is unsupported.
- Orca exposes no stable CLI version or protocol marker, so readiness is the compatibility gate rather than a version floor.
- Only the verified terminal-handle and worktree result fields are accepted; speculative response shapes are rejected.
- The composer row finder is border-row based, so an UNBORDERED composer row is discarded before the shared classifier is reached.
  Claude's current idle composer is exactly that shape - a bare `❯` plus U+00A0 - and measures `unknown` here, with or without the shared Unicode-blank trim (`tests/fm-backend-orca.test.sh`'s `test_composer_state_claude_unbordered_nbsp_row_is_unknown`).
  A blank inside a BORDERED composer's content is still trimmed by the shared owner and reads `empty`.
  The gap costs delivery, never safety - `unknown` is non-`empty`, so injection is refused - and the away-mode daemon accepts only tmux and herdr as supervisor backends in any case; `docs/herdr-backend.md`'s 2026-07-26 incident record owns the full contract.
