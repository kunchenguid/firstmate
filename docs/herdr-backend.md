# Herdr runtime backend

Herdr is an experimental agent-native terminal backend with native per-pane agent state and push events.
Firstmate requires Herdr protocol 14 or newer; broad backend verification covers versions 0.7.1, 0.7.3, 0.7.4, 0.7.5, and 0.8.0, while protocol-16 features remain gated by availability.
Herdr provides the terminal session while Treehouse continues to provide task worktrees.
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md#runtime-backend-configbackend--fm_backend) owns shared backend selection and metadata semantics.

## Setup

Pick Herdr when you want native busy, idle, and blocked state and accept the experimental limits below.

Prerequisites:

- Herdr protocol 14 or newer, installed from [herdr.dev](https://herdr.dev).
- `jq` for JSON responses.
- The universal harness and toolchain requirements in [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#toolchain).
- `python3` only for optional native event subscription.

Herdr is dual-licensed AGPL-3.0-or-later or commercial.
Firstmate invokes its CLI as a separate process.

Select Herdr with local `config/backend` containing `herdr`, `FM_BACKEND=herdr` for one launch, or an explicit request to Firstmate.
A remote second-mate agent is the one case with no choice: it always runs on Herdr, and [`remote-secondmates.md`](remote-secondmates.md) owns that requirement and the readiness its host must meet.
It is also auto-detected when the primary runs natively under `HERDR_ENV=1` and is not inside tmux.
A tmux pane nested inside Herdr resolves to tmux because the innermost multiplexer wins.
An auto-detected Herdr spawn prints an opt-out notice.

Spawn stops before creating a Herdr container or acquiring a task worktree when `herdr`, `jq`, or the protocol floor is unavailable.
No separate first-run provisioning is required.

The required CI lane uses the pinned installers in `bin/fm-install-herdr.sh` and `bin/fm-install-treehouse.sh`.
Those script headers own release assets, checksums, download bounds, and post-install gates.
Real harness credential tests remain opt-in rather than part of default CI.

## Watching and task containers

The ordinary topology puts one task tab per endpoint in the exact workspace of the Firstmate or secondmate that launches it.
When the launcher has no Herdr workspace to inherit, the adapter maintains one durable home-labeled workspace instead.
The primary home label is `firstmate`.
A secondmate home label is `2ndmate-<secondmate-id>`, derived from its validated `.fm-secondmate-home` marker.
A secondmate launched by the primary receives a narrowly scoped home override during container creation.

Attach to the selected named Herdr session and switch to the relevant home workspace to watch its task tabs.
Routine supervision uses `bin/fm-peek.sh <id>` and `FM_HOME=<home> bin/fm-send.sh <id> '<text>'` without attaching.

Workspace and tab creation use `--no-focus`.
The first workspace in a completely empty Herdr session must become focused because no prior target exists, but later task creation does not intentionally steal focus.

Herdr does not enforce workspace or tab label uniqueness, so a label can never decide where a worker goes.
Herdr 0.7.5 exports `HERDR_ENV`, `HERDR_PANE_ID`, `HERDR_SESSION`, `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`, `HERDR_TAB_ID`, and `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID` into every process it manages a pane for, and a Firstmate or secondmate agent's own commands inherit them.
Older injection shapes are unverified, so a claimed launcher pane without the injected socket identity cannot be trusted.
A crewmate or scout is created in the exact workspace that identity currently resolves to, read live from Herdr rather than from the injected snapshot, so the worker always appears beside the agent that launched it.
Duplicate labels elsewhere in the session are irrelevant, and the globally focused workspace is never the target.
A `--secondmate` launch is the deliberate exception: it stands up that secondmate home's own workspace instead of joining the launcher's.

A claimed parent identity that cannot be resolved exactly stops the spawn before any worker endpoint exists, rather than falling back to a label search.
That covers a missing or unusable socket identity, a closed or unreadable launcher pane, a pane and tab that disagree about their workspace, a workspace missing from the session, and a pane belonging to another named session or Herdr server.

Firstmate running outside Herdr entirely has no launcher workspace to inherit, so its workers use this home's own labeled workspace, created on first use.
That path needs the home label to identify exactly one workspace: two workspaces sharing it are an unresolvable placement and refuse rather than adopting either.
Avoid naming a personal workspace `firstmate` or `2ndmate-<id>` for that reason, and because the adapter cannot distinguish that label collision from its own container.
An older secondmate workspace using `firstmate-<id>` is not migrated automatically; rename it manually before expecting new tasks or recovery to use it.
Recovery and list-live still scan the first workspace matching the home label, because they address panes they already recorded rather than choosing where new work goes.

Existing task operations use recorded endpoint ids and do not move a live task when labels change.
The per-home workspace is reused while it has task tabs.
Closing its last tab can remove the workspace, and the next spawn recreates it.

## Default-tab prune safety

`herdr workspace create` seeds one default tab.
Firstmate prunes it only after a real task tab exists and only when the same create response supplied the seeded tab id.
An adopted workspace never supplies that id and can never enter the prune path, regardless of labels or tab count.
Immediately before close, Firstmate rechecks the exact tab, expected seed label, and native agent state.
A working seed pane is never closed.

This created-versus-adopted gate is a destructive safety boundary.
A prior label heuristic could adopt a captain-owned workspace named `firstmate` and close its live seed-shaped tab.
The current structural gate removes label inference from cleanup authority.
`tests/fm-backend-herdr-prune-safety-e2e.test.sh` reproduces the collision in an isolated named session and proves the adopted pane remains untouched.

## Endpoint metadata

```text
backend=herdr
window=<session>:<pane-id>
herdr_session=<session>
herdr_workspace_id=<workspace-id>
herdr_tab_id=<tab-id>
herdr_pane_id=<pane-id>
```

A Herdr pane id contains a colon, so the adapter splits `window=` on the first colon only.
The recorded pane is the operational fast path.
Workspace and tab ids support verification and cleanup but are not inferred from mutable labels during normal operation.

## Current transport behavior

The adapter starts and polls a named server before workspace, tab, pane, or agent calls.
Every Herdr invocation goes through `fm_backend_herdr_cli`, which sets the environment and passes an explicit trailing `--session <name>`.
An environment variable alone is not reliable when another Herdr server is running.
When the selected named server is not running, the adapter launches it without inherited Firstmate home and directory overrides, harness identity markers, or the supervision-model override.
Herdr passes its server startup environment to every later pane, so retaining those values could misroute panes for another Firstmate home or harness.
An already-running server is reused without restart or environment changes.
Explicit named-session routing and unrelated launch environment remain intact.

Literal text and Enter are separate operations on `fm-send.sh`'s typed plane; ordinary local text steers instead use the durable steering inbox and send only its best-effort constant doorbell through this adapter.
Spawn-time fixed commands may use Herdr's atomic run primitive.
Enter, Escape, and Ctrl-C are supported.
Typed-plane slash input, and dollar-prefixed skill input for Codex, uses the shared harness-aware settle before the first Enter so a completion popup cannot consume it.
Typed-plane text is typed once; only Enter is retried.

On an idle or done native baseline, submit confirmation first waits for `working` or `blocked` across a bounded polling window.
If native status stays idle, the shared composer verdict is the next positive signal: a cleared composer is delivery, and proven pending text retries Enter.
After the retry budget, `fm_composer_queued_enter_verdict` treats proven pending text plus a generating busy signal as a queued delivered Enter, and keeps an idle pending composer as a genuine swallow.
On an already active or unreadable baseline, the adapter falls back to conservative composer clearance, with a pre-Enter rendered-footer transition when that baseline is unavailable.
A fully unreadable target stops retrying and reports unknown.
blocked is not treated as a queued-Enter busy signal, so a Cursor pane that reports blocked in every state does not receive that conversion.

Some harnesses never present a legibly idle native baseline at all, so the composer fallback is their only path.
Herdr reports a Cursor pane `blocked` in every state, and Cursor's mid-turn composer renders its placeholder beside a right-aligned busy token, which is composer content and therefore `pending` on a composer that holds no user text.
That fallback alone reported every delivered steer as unconfirmed, so it is paired with a rendered-footer transition: the pane's verified busy footer is read once before the first Enter, and an idle-to-busy transition across that Enter confirms the submit.
It is the same semantic signal the native path uses and the same one the tmux submit core reads.
A pane already mid-turn cannot borrow a rendered-footer transition as proof of this delivery; after retries, only proven pending text plus native `working` can establish that its Enter was accepted and queued.
The composer verdict itself is deliberately unchanged: a right-aligned status token on the composer row stays content for every other caller, including the away-mode pre-injection guard.
The poll density bounds the residual possibility of an extremely fast complete turn; a missed native transition falls through to the composer verdict rather than reporting a false swallow.

`pane read --lines N` can return empty output when N is below the viewport height.
The capture owner requests at least 200 lines from Herdr and trims locally to the caller's bound.
This generous floor is required for small composer and peek reads.

Herdr's native agent state can read idle while a harness waits on its own long foreground tool.
The shared crew-state path therefore accepts a native `busy` as evidence of activity but never a native `idle` as evidence that a worker has stopped; the task's own semantic busy state (`bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`) decides that.
A human-blocked permission dialog has no busy banner and still surfaces.

## Composer and injection safety

Herdr has no direct cursor-row primitive.
The adapter is a thin capture: it hands a bounded ANSI tail plus Herdr's capability facts to the fleet-wide classifier in `bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`, which owns every shape - bordered boxes, bare agent-glyph rows (including muse's `⟩`, which the adapter's retired local pattern silently omitted), opencode's left bar, and the Pi separator region this adapter pioneered, admitted only when native `agent get` identity is exactly Pi and state is idle or done.
A blocked Pi is parked on an interactive prompt, so its blank composer region is a menu's and not a free composer's; that state defers instead of proving emptiness.
A working Pi, pending middle row, missing identity, incomplete separator pair, or over-tall candidate remains unknown or pending.
Identity stays a lazy second read, consulted only when a separator pair could change the verdict.

ANSI capture preserves de-emphasized placeholder style.
`bin/fm-composer-lib.sh` is the fleet-wide owner that strips dim or faint runs and dark truecolor placeholders while retaining bright typed input.
If the ANSI capture ever fails, the plain fallback declares itself unstyled and the classifier degrades a glyph row carrying trailing text to `unknown` instead of misreading ghost suggestions as typed input, which safely defers injection and eventually raises the wedge alarm.

A bare shell prompt is never an empty agent composer.
Away-mode injection proceeds only on an affirmative `empty` result, never on unknown.
This prevents a dead agent pane from receiving and possibly executing an escalation as shell input.

The current operational envelope starts with U+2063 and `FIRSTMATE_OP: `.
The separate routed-request carrier uses `[fm-from-firstmate]` plus U+2063.
U+2063 survives Herdr terminal input as text, unlike the legacy ASCII control separator that could erase the visible routing label.
`bin/fm-operational-input.sh` owns current operational construction and parsing, and the AFK skill owns legacy away-input compatibility.
No Herdr-specific copy of that protocol exists.

## Restart and liveness behavior

Stopping and restarting a named Herdr server preserves workspace, tab, pane, and label ids, but the underlying harness processes and live agent registrations do not survive.
A restored same-labeled tab with a missing pane or no registered agent is a husk.
Create replaces only a confidently dead or no-agent husk, creates the replacement before closing the old tab, and refuses live or unknown states.
This prevents closing the workspace's last tab before a replacement exists.

The generic Herdr agent-liveness probe reuses the same classifier.
A structurally gone pane becomes `missing`, a restored agent-less shell becomes `dead`, a registered agent becomes `alive`, and an unexpected read becomes `unreadable`.
Unlike tmux process-name inspection, native registration can classify Pi without guessing from a generic interpreter name.

The session-start sweep uses this probe.
Mid-session secondmate agent-process liveness is not implemented because idle secondmates are deliberately exempt from stale-pane escalation and need a separate periodic identity signal.

## Push events and polling fallback

Protocol 16 can subscribe to `pane.agent_status_changed` over one bounded Unix-socket reader.
`bin/fm-transition-lib.sh` owns the backend-neutral transition vocabulary and policy.
The Herdr adapter subscribes before reconciling current levels, buffers edges during reconciliation, and returns fresh blocked transitions for this home's panes.
The watcher maps the pane back to the task and skips secondmate endpoints, declared `paused:` waits, and verified `captain-held` transfers, because a declared wait already names the human the fast escalation would report and is left to the watcher's own bounded pause cadence.

The push path only shortens latency.
Polling runs every cycle and remains the permanent fallback when protocol 16, the event schema, Python, connection, subscription, or repeated reader execution is unavailable.
There is still one watcher process; the event reader is a bounded child of that watcher.

`tests/fm-backend-herdr-eventwait-smoke.test.sh`, `tests/fm-transition-lib.test.sh`, and `tests/fm-supervision-events.test.sh` cover capability, subscribe-then-reconcile ordering, dedupe, exemptions, and polling fallback.

## Away-mode supervisor support

The away daemon supports tmux and Herdr supervisor panes only.
It refuses an unsupported supervisor backend rather than applying the wrong transport.
For Herdr, target existence, native state, capture, composer state, and verified submit all route through the shared backend dispatcher and the explicit named-session CLI owner.
The pane-independent max-defer alert is configured in [`wedge-alarm.md`](wedge-alarm.md).

Harnesses with native tracked background execution can run the daemon in their terminal.
Pi has no such mechanism.
`bin/fm-afk-launch.sh` therefore creates a dedicated unfocused Herdr workspace, runs the daemon there with an explicit supervisor target and backend, records the exact daemon pane, and closes only that pane on stop.
It never splits the captain's active tab and never uses shell `&`.
Recovery reconciles only the recorded exact id.

On stop, the daemon receives termination while `state/.afk` still exists so its final flush can run, the recorded terminal is closed, and the AFK flag is removed last.
A fresh entry clears stale transient escalation caches, while durable queue and task records remain authoritative.

## Destructive lab safety

Never use ambient `herdr server stop` for Firstmate verification.
An environment-only session selection can silently reach a different running server, and the ambient stop command has no explicit target.

`bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh` is the sole supported lifecycle helper for isolated verification.
It provisions only non-default names beginning with `fm-lab-`, appends an explicit `--session` to allowed task commands, refuses caller-supplied session flags and server/session lifecycle subcommands, and performs destructive stop/delete only through its guarded lifecycle actions.
Immediately before every destructive call it re-queries the named session and refuses empty, missing, literal `default`, or `default:true` identities.
Its before/after tripwire requires the live default-session snapshot to remain byte-identical.

The helper's header and `--help` own exact commands.
Tests use thin compatibility wrappers in `tests/herdr-test-safety.sh` and never duplicate the destructive policy.

## Active limits

- Herdr remains experimental.
- Mutable labels can collide; they are never placement or destructive authority.
- A Firstmate outside Herdr cannot resolve a launcher workspace, so a colliding home label refuses new spawns until the collision is cleared.
- Ghost and placeholder recognition uses ANSI de-emphasis when available; an unstyled glyph row carrying trailing non-idle text fails safely to `unknown`.
- Mid-session secondmate agent-process liveness is not implemented.
- Only tmux and Herdr can host the away-mode supervisor terminal.
