# Configuration

The files and environment variables you set to operate firstmate.

## Orchestrator behavior (AGENTS.md)

The shared orchestrator behavior lives in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) - edit it like any prompt when the fleet is empty, or dispatch shared-repo edits to a crewmate while tasks are in flight.

## Backlog backend (.tasks.toml / tasks-axi)

The tracked `.tasks.toml` pins the optional `tasks-axi` markdown backend to `data/backlog.md`, with `done_keep = 10` and an archive at `data/done-archive.md`.
When compatible `tasks-axi` is on `PATH`, firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations and keeps secondmate transfers behind `fm-backlog-handoff.sh` validation; without it, backlog bookkeeping remains manual.
Compatible means the shared bootstrap probe accepts `tasks-axi --version` as 0.1.1 or newer.

## Captain preferences (data/captain.md)

Personal preferences for one captain's fleet live locally in `data/captain.md`; it is gitignored and read after `data/projects.md` and optional `data/secondmates.md` during bootstrap.

## Secondmate routes (data/secondmates.md)

Persistent secondmate routes live locally in `data/secondmates.md`.
Each line records the secondmate id, charter summary, absolute home path, natural-language scope, project clone list, and added date; `fm-home-seed.sh validate` refuses duplicate ids, duplicate homes, and nested or overlapping homes.
The main first mate routes by reading those scopes with judgment; the project list is provisioning data, not exclusive ownership.
Use `fm-home-seed.sh <id> - <project>...` to lease a fresh firstmate worktree for the secondmate home.
The lease is held under the secondmate id until explicit retirement or seed rollback returns it, so normal restarts do not free or recycle the home.
Teardown of a leased home fails closed if `treehouse return` cannot release the lease; plain-clone homes with no treehouse pool slot are removed directly.
Secondmate routes cover `no-mistakes` and `direct-PR` projects; `local-only` projects remain main-firstmate work.
For `no-mistakes` projects, seeding initializes only projects newly cloned into a secondmate home and refuses to mutate a preexisting clone that is not already initialized.
After creating a secondmate, move existing main-backlog items that you have judged in-scope with `fm-backlog-handoff.sh <secondmate-id> <item-key>...`; it is idempotent and refuses in-flight items or non-secondmate homes.
Set `FM_SECONDMATE_CHARTER` to seed from inline charter text when no filled charter brief exists; set `FM_SECONDMATE_SCOPE` when the routing scope should differ from the charter text.

## FM_HOME

`FM_HOME` selects the operational home for one firstmate instance.
When it is unset, the repo root is the home; when it is set, scripts still run from this repo's `bin/`, but `state/`, `data/`, `config/`, and `projects/` come from `$FM_HOME`.
`FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE` overrides the firstmate repo root used by scripts, including the primary checkout watched by the worktree-tangle guard.
When `FM_HOME` is unset, it also behaves as the old whole-root override.
`FM_STATE_OVERRIDE`, `FM_DATA_OVERRIDE`, `FM_PROJECTS_OVERRIDE`, and `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` override individual operational directories for tests and specialized harness setup.

## Harness support

claude, codex, opencode, and pi are all empirically verified; new harnesses get verified through a supervised trial task before joining the set.
The verified adapter knowledge - busy signatures, interrupt and exit commands, skill-invocation syntax, and per-harness quirks - lives in [`.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md).
Launch mechanics, including the verified command templates, live in [`bin/fm-spawn.sh`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh).

## Toolchain

On first launch the first mate detects what its required toolchain is missing or too old (tmux, node, gh, treehouse with durable lease support, no-mistakes v1.31.2 or newer, gh-axi, chrome-devtools-axi, lavish-axi), lists it with the exact install commands, and installs only after you say go.
If compatible `tasks-axi` is already on `PATH`, bootstrap records it as an optional capability fact and firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations; when it is absent or incompatible, firstmate keeps hand-editing `data/backlog.md` exactly as before.
Bootstrap also reports a `TANGLE:` line when `FM_ROOT` is on a named non-default branch; follow the printed checkout remediation rather than treating it as an installable tool problem.
Bootstrap also runs the guarded local secondmate sync for recorded live secondmate homes.
It emits `SECONDMATE_SYNC:` only when a home was skipped for an actionable reason, and `NUDGE_SECONDMATES:` only when a running home advanced and its instruction surface changed.
