# Task intake

This skill owns intake routing, task delivery resolution, and filling the brief.
The always-loaded authority and lifecycle boundaries remain in `AGENTS.md`.
[`quota-array-dispatch`](../quota-array-dispatch/SKILL.md#1-eligibility) is the single owner of matched-array selection, candidate accounting, quota uncertainty, credential safety, reasoning-class preservation, and tie handling.
Load it before choosing among a matched profile array; apply its complete procedure rather than inferring a route from a profile name or quota summary.
[`harness-adapters`](../harness-adapters/SKILL.md) owns verified harnesses, model/provider discovery, and effort fallback.

## Dispatch profiles

When dispatch profiles exist, consult them at every crewmate or scout intake and pass the resolved concrete profile required by `fm-spawn`.
Routing precedence is an explicit per-task captain override, then the best-fit configured rule, then the configured default, then the static crewmate harness.
Preserve malformed profile configuration as an actionable error rather than selecting around it.
Run `bin/fm-dispatch-resolve.sh` directly on the written brief in the same turn, with no preflight, and on `clear` pass its `profile:` line to `fm-spawn` unless you state a reason to override; `ambiguous`, `escalate`, `error`, and off all mean the intake above, unchanged (contract: `docs/configuration.md` "Typed dispatch resolution").

## Delivery and branches

Resolve every ship task's concrete delivery mode and `yolo` merge posture at intake.
Pass the mode explicitly to the brief, and pass both values explicitly to the spawn and any scout promotion; each command refuses to guess the values it consumes.
A current explicit captain instruction wins; otherwise the project's registry entry is the captain's standing posture, and dropping below its rigor needs a reason you can state.
Resolve the project's registered ship-branch prefix the same way, via `bin/fm-project-mode.sh --branch-prefix <project>`, and pass it explicitly to the brief, ship spawn, and scout promotion as `--branch-prefix` (default `fm/` needs no flag).
When the work must start from and target a branch other than the project's default, such as a named feature or release branch, pass it to the ship or scout brief and spawn as `--base-branch <branch>`; any promotion reads it from task meta.
On a `no-mistakes-prod-only` project, classify the task's surface: internal-only tooling, automation, contributor or operator process, and release or submission work ships `direct-PR`, while product-facing, mixed, and uncertain work ships `no-mistakes`; never infer internal-only from file location or project name.
An unregistered project or absent registry resolves to `no-mistakes` with yolo off, and the registration gap goes to the captain.
Record the resulting mode, `yolo` merge posture, and the one-line reason for any deviation in the backlog item note.

## Fill the brief

Use `bin/fm-brief.sh`'s scaffold as the contract, then fill `## Captain's intent` (`{TASK}`) with the captain's own ask and any boundary the captain stated, plus the context needed to read it, including the substance of any report, decision, or PR the ask refers to; never widen the ask there into a general goal or an enumerated coverage list, because the reviewer treats that subsection as acceptance criteria.
Fill `## Firstmate spec` (`{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}`) with only the build instructions that ask requires, naming what stays out of scope when the ask is narrow; a generalization, consistency sweep, or extra hardening the captain did not ask for is follow-up work to note, not scope to add.
[`bin/fm-dod-lib.sh`](../../../bin/fm-dod-lib.sh) owns intent authoring without added speaker labels or direct address, its provenance markers, what a no-mistakes worker may pass as `--intent`, and the string's self-sufficiency rule.
Keep additions task-specific rather than repeating lifecycle instructions, and alter generated sections only when the task genuinely differs from the standard shape.
