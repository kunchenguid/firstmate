# Task lifecycle

Load this skill before classifying, recording, dispatching, validating, landing, tearing down, promoting, or completing task work, before mutating a backlog work item, and before creating a crewmate brief.
The prime directives in `AGENTS.md` remain authoritative and this procedure never expands merge, discard, project-write, or outward-facing authority.

## Intake and authority

Resolve the project independently for every request.
An explicit project wins, a clear follow-up inherits its referent, and otherwise match the request against the registry, work under way, and project code or README.
Proceed on one confident match while naming the project in plain language; ask one concise question when multiple or no projects plausibly match.

Route by the nature of the work against each registered secondmate scope, not by a non-exclusive clone list.
Keep `local-only` work in the main home.
Send in-scope work to the fitting secondmate unless it is blocked or the captain explicitly redirects it; do not read the secondmate's chat because marked routed replies return through its status or referenced document.
If no secondmate scope fits, use the main home or discuss creating an appropriate persistent secondmate.

Classify the deliverable:

- **Ship** is the default and produces a project change through the selected delivery mode.
- **Scout** produces knowledge in `data/<id>/report.md`, never a PR, and is the default for investigation, diagnosis, planning, reproduction, or audit requests that do not clearly include implementation.

A diagnostic request, report, recommendation, or implementation-ready finding is evidence, not authorization to change code.
Implementation requires a separate request or other clear implementation scope.

Classify work as dispatchable when it does not overlap work under way, or queued and blocked when it touches the same project subsystem or depends on unlanded work.
Dispatch independent work immediately with no concurrency cap, serialize coarse overlaps, and record blockers durably.
Write the task-specific brief before spawning.

## Dispatch and supervision handoff

Spawn only through `bin/fm-spawn.sh` after the profile and backend checks in `AGENTS.md` section 4.
The spawn must resolve a genuine isolated task worktree distinct from the primary checkout; a failed isolation assertion stops the task.
After spawning, confirm the worker is processing the brief, handle any trust dialog through `harness-adapters`, and record ship or scout work as under way.
A persistent secondmate is recorded in the secondmate registry and runtime state, never as a backlog work item.

Steer a worker with short single-line messages through fail-closed `fm-send`; put long instructions in a file.
A secondmate's routed reply returns through status or a document pointer, not by firstmate peeking into its chat.
Supervise all live work under `AGENTS.md` section 8.

## Selected delivery path and approval authority

The selected delivery path owns its own rigor.
When no-mistakes is selected, no-mistakes alone owns review, fixes, tests, documentation, push, PR, and CI; otherwise follow the faster path without adding an independent reviewer.
Never hold work outside no-mistakes for a manual clean verdict, stack serial manual reviews, or infer authority for one from security, architecture, or risk alone.
A separate review or audit is allowed only when the captain explicitly requests that deliverable or the authorized task is a knowledge-only review; one named question remains scoped to that question.
If fast-path risk needs more rigor, escalate whether to use no-mistakes instead of inventing a manual gate.
The path's worker, automated gates, and captain approval remain authoritative:

- **no-mistakes** runs the full pipeline through a PR, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **direct-PR** has the worker push and open a PR without the no-mistakes pipeline, then waits for the configured merge authority.
- **local-only** has the worker stop with a clean ready branch, then waits for the configured merge authority before firstmate uses the guarded fast-forward merge path.

Delivery mode and `yolo` are orthogonal.
With `yolo` off, the captain owns ask-user findings, PR merges, and local-only merge approval.
With `yolo` on, firstmate decides those routine gates and merges only green or otherwise approved work, but still escalates destructive, irreversible, and security-sensitive choices.
Never merge a red PR.
Use `bin/fm-pr-merge.sh` for every task PR merge so merge metadata is recorded, and use `bin/fm-merge-local.sh` for approved local-only landing; never call a lower-level merge command around their guards.
After an autonomous merge, give the captain a one-line full-URL or local-main outcome.

## Validate

For a no-mistakes ship, trigger validation on the same worker after its implementation commit, using the harness invocation owned by `harness-adapters`.
The task worker that starts a no-mistakes run drives the pipeline and owns every `no-mistakes axi run` and `no-mistakes axi respond` call through the next gate or outcome.
Firstmate never invokes `no-mistakes axi respond` for a crew-owned run.

An ask-user finding returns as `needs-decision`; firstmate decides only when the configured authority permits, otherwise escalates to the captain.
Send the same worker one exact decision naming the decision key, step, action, affected finding IDs, instructions where needed, and exact response command.
Require the matching `resolved` event, forbid `--yes`, and require the worker to process every synchronous return until completion or a genuinely new escalation.
Resume fleet supervision immediately after the decision lands.

Judge validation by the current-code-matched run step through `bin/fm-crew-state.sh`, not by shell liveness or the last status event.
Running, fixing, or CI states remain working; parked approval or fix-review states require the worker to follow the active gate help; passed or checks-passed is done; failed or cancelled is failed.
A worker hand-editing, committing, aborting, or restarting during an active validation run duplicates pipeline ownership; steer it back to the gate response flow.
The worker reports the PR when CI first becomes green rather than waiting for merge monitoring to finish.

## PR ready, landing, and teardown

For PR-based ship tasks, the ready signal depends on mode: `no-mistakes` reports `done: PR <url> checks green` after CI is green, while `direct-PR` reports `done: PR <url>` after opening the PR.
Run `bin/fm-pr-check.sh <id> <PR url>` to record `pr=` and any forge `pr_head=` and arm the authenticated merge poll.
Tell the captain the PR's full URL, always the complete `https://...` link rather than a bare `#number`, a concise outcome summary, and the no-mistakes risk level when applicable.
A captain instruction to merge is explicit authority; `yolo` is the only standing routine authority.
For any custom `state/<id>.check.sh` you write yourself, keep it an ordinary single-link mode-`0700` file, print one line only when firstmate should wake, print nothing otherwise, finish before `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT`, then bind its current bytes with `bin/fm-check-register.sh <id>` before the watcher may execute it.

Tear down a ship task only after landing is confirmed.
A teardown refusal for uncommitted or unlanded work is a stop-and-investigate result, never an obstacle to bypass.
Never force teardown without explicit discard authority.
After successful teardown, record completion, retain only the configured recent Done history, and re-evaluate queued work whose blockers and time gates have cleared.

A secondmate is persistent and an empty queue is healthy.
Retire one only on an explicit captain or main-firstmate decision, after loading `secondmate-provisioning`; its home must contain no work under way, and forced discard still requires explicit captain authority.

## Scout outcome and promotion

A completed scout must leave a self-contained report before its scratch worktree can be discarded.
Read the report, relay its findings rather than merely saying it finished, record the report as the Done artifact, and re-evaluate the queue.
A report may recommend implementation but does not authorize it.
Before treating the investigation or any visual review as complete, load `decision-hold-lifecycle`; teardown enforces that shared completion gate.
When implementation is separately authorized, promote the existing scout through `bin/fm-promote.sh` rather than creating a duplicate task.
The promoted worker must inventory scratch state, return to a clean default-branch base, carry over only intended fix changes, create the ship branch, and follow the project's selected delivery path.
Scratch commits and debug edits never ride along, and a reproduced bug becomes the regression test.

## Backlog contract

`data/backlog.md` is the durable queue.
It tracks work items only, never agents; persistent secondmates never appear as backlog items.
Work routed to a secondmate is recorded in that secondmate home's own backlog, not the main backlog.
When a main-side thread such as a pending captain decision or relay reminder is worth durable tracking, file it as its own work item; use `tasks-axi hold <id> --reason "<reason>" --kind captain` for a captain-gated thread.
Unresolved decisions discovered by investigations or visual reviews follow `decision-hold-lifecycle`, which owns their mandatory backlog lifecycle.
Update the backlog on every dispatch, completion, and decision for a work item.
Re-evaluate queued work after every teardown and heartbeat, dispatching items only when dependencies and time gates have cleared.

`.tasks.toml`, `docs/configuration.md`, and current `tasks-axi --help` own the backlog schema, compatibility, retention, and routine command syntax.
Use compatible `tasks-axi` when the configured backend selects it and the documented manual path otherwise; keep only the configured recent Done entries.
`secondmate-provisioning` and `bin/fm-backlog-handoff.sh` own cross-home handoff safety.

Keep free-form notes free of temporary paths, moving versions, ephemeral identifiers, and copied state that will rot.
Inspect the current task note before replacing its considered body, and archive the superseded body when recoverability matters rather than appending by default.
Verify volatile details against their authoritative config, live system, or API before acting, and correct or delete stale prose immediately.
Preserve durable structured identifiers, dependencies, and completion artifact links, and route reusable knowledge to `AGENTS.md` section 6 rather than scattering it through task notes.

## Crewmate briefs

`bin/fm-brief.sh` and its help own scaffold syntax, generated variants, status protocol, delivery-mode definitions of done, and exact safety mechanics.
Use its scaffold as the contract, then replace every `{TASK}` placeholder with a clear task description, acceptance criteria, constraints, and necessary context before dispatch or seeding.
Keep additions task-specific rather than repeating lifecycle instructions, and alter generated sections only when the task genuinely differs from the standard shape.

Every ship brief must retain the worktree-isolation assertion and stop if launched in the primary checkout.
If a ship task touches firstmate's shared tracked material, explicitly require `firstmate-coding-guidelines` before editing.
If a task will drive Herdr lifecycle behavior, scaffold with `--herdr-lab`; if that need appears after an unguarded scaffold, stop and regenerate rather than adding commands by hand.
The generated Herdr contract must use a named non-`default` isolated lab and its guarded helper for every lifecycle action.

Load `secondmate-provisioning` before creating or using a charter brief and preserve its idle-by-default and marked-return-channel contracts.
Status appends are sparse supervisor-actionable events, not routine progress; `bin/fm-classify-lib.sh` owns keyed open and resolved semantics.
The scaffold is a safety contract, not a suggestion.
