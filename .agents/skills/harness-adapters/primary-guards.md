# Primary-session guards and watcher supervision

This file covers firstmate's OWN primary session: its turn-end guard, its PreToolUse seatbelts, its delegation-shape guard, its session-start enforcement, and its watcher supervision.
Read it when inspecting, changing, or debugging that machinery.
An ordinary crewmate or secondmate spawn, recovery, interrupt, exit, or resume never needs it.

The primary-session "no turn ends blind" guard contract and harness hook installation paths live in `docs/turnend-guard.md`.
The primary-session watcher wake protocols are rendered from `docs/supervision-protocols/` by `bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh`.

## Primary turn-end guard

The primary integrations for `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, `pi-signed`, and `grok` have empirically validated hook paths for the "no turn ends blind" guard.
`claude` and `codex` block directly through Stop hooks that preserve exit status 2 and stderr from `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
`opencode`, `pi`, and `pi-signed` expose passive lifecycle callbacks and force one bounded follow-up when the shared predicate blocks.
Grok selects native blocking or its pre-native bounded resume fallback from the exact running Stop payload; [`docs/turnend-guard.md`](../../../docs/turnend-guard.md) owns that contract.
Kimi is outside the primary turn-end guard scope, while `docs/turnend-guard.md` owns its separate guarded global hook for crew wake signals.
muse is CREWMATE/SCOUT ONLY and has no primary integration at all: its plugin engine (its only hook surface) is disabled in the default build, and its Claude-compatible hook dialect names `asyncRewake` and model reawakening as explicitly unsupported, which is exactly what a firstmate primary's turn-end supervision needs.
`bin/fm-spawn.sh` refuses a `--secondmate` launch on muse for that reason.
The exact hook files, commands, scoping rules, and fail-open tradeoffs are owned by `docs/turnend-guard.md`.
`docs/verification/supervision.md` "Turn-end guard" owns active validation evidence.
When changing any primary turn-end hook, validate the real harness behavior in a scratch project or throwaway home before trusting it, then update that doc and the relevant concise fact in that harness's `adapters/<harness>.md`.

## Primary pre-arm (PreToolUse) seatbelt

The primary integrations for `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, `pi-signed`, and `grok` also have wired PreToolUse-equivalent hooks that deny a watcher-arm anti-pattern (shell `&`, truncating pipe, bundling, broad `pkill -f fm-watch`) before it runs.
`claude` and `codex` block directly through PreToolUse hooks; `grok` blocks the same way but requires every `$VAR` reference in its hook `command` string to carry an inline `:-default` or it fails to launch the hook entirely.
`opencode`, `pi`, and `pi-signed` block by throwing from `tool.execute.before` / returning `{block: true}` from `tool_call`.
The exact hook files, commands, output-shaping quirks (Claude Code only honors the deny when stdout is empty), and validation transcripts are owned by `docs/arm-pretool-check.md`.
When changing any watcher-arm PreToolUse hook, validate the real harness behavior in a scratch project before trusting it, then update that doc.
## Primary delegation-shape guard

Claude exposes built-in delegation, scheduling, and worktree tools that a primary session can use to create work with no `state/<id>.meta`, which makes the whole guard stack inert because every guard counts that metadata.
The shipped mechanism is `bin/fm-subagent-pretool-check.sh`, a primary-home PreToolUse guard that denies a delegation-SHAPED tool name.
Claude primaries should also use an untracked per-home local `permissions.deny` list as hardening for known Claude delegation tools, because it removes them from the model's schema so they are never offered.
That deny list must not ship in tracked `.claude/settings.json` because it is Claude-only rather than harness-agnostic, and because tracked project settings propagate into linked worktrees where they disarm legitimate crewmates.
`docs/subagent-guard.md` owns the full contract, the local deny-list recommendation, the `FM_ALLOW_SUBAGENT=1` escape hatch, and the per-harness applicability review.

Two verified facts worth pinning here.
The subagent tool presents to the model as `Agent`, and on Claude Code 2.1.217 both `Agent` and `Task` work as `permissions.deny` keys, verified by an A/B with a nonsense-name control.
`permissions.allow` is a pre-approval list rather than an availability list, so there is no fail-closed positive allowlist.

## Primary session start

AGENTS.md section 3 remains the behavioral owner for session start, while tracked native adapters enforce it idempotently at session open through one of two tiers.
Before inspecting or changing session-open behavior, read `docs/sessionstart-nudge.md`, the single owner of tier assignment, per-surface transports, source routing, the runtime bound, and fail-open behavior.
`docs/verification/supervision.md` "Native session-start delivery" owns active dated commands, payloads, and evidence.

## Primary watcher supervision

At session start, `bin/fm-session-start.sh` prints exactly one watcher supervision block for the detected primary harness.
Do not substitute another harness's wait shape when resuming supervision.
Claude's Stop `asyncRewake` hook (`bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh`) owns tokenless re-arm around `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`, and Grok uses tracked background-notify cycles around `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`.
Codex uses bounded foreground checkpoints through `bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh` because Codex cannot reason while a foreground tool call is running.
OpenCode uses `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js`, which coordinates with the turn-end guard plugin and wakes the TUI with `client.session.promptAsync`.
Pi and pi-signed use the tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` plus the tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts`, both project-local extensions the Pi engine auto-discovers once trusted.
When changing any primary watcher adapter, update `docs/supervision-protocols/`, `docs/turnend-guard.md` if a shared idle or turn-end hook changed, and the relevant concise fact in that harness's `adapters/<harness>.md`.
