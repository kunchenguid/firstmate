# Claude

Busy hooks verified 2026-07-28 on Claude Code 2.1.220.

## Operating facts

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy | Owned hooks: `UserPromptSubmit` opens while `Stop`, `StopFailure`, and `SessionEnd` close; manual interrupt emits no hook, so control reports delivered keys and live endpoint only, publishes no idle event or cancellation claim, and usually leaves `claude-hook` busy. |
| Exit | `/exit`. |
| Interrupt | Single Escape. |
| Skill | `/<skill>`, for example `/no-mistakes`. |
| Model | `--model <model>`; discover through the interactive `/model` picker, with alias or full-name shape documented by `claude --help`. |
| Effort | `--effort <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max>`, verified on 2.1.196. |

Fresh-worktree or first-machine launch may show a workspace-trust dialog: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` bypasses PERMISSION checks only, never that separate gate.
`../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` now clears it automatically on every launch and relaunch, so firstmate no longer peeks or sends a key for it.
The dialog is cancel-first and cancel-focused by default (verified live, Claude Code 2.1.251): a bare Enter selects "No, exit" and quits claude immediately, so never accept it with a plain `--key Enter` - the detector and the required Down-then-Enter sequence live in `../../../bin/fm-composer-lib.sh` (`fm_composer_claude_trust_dialog_state`) and `fm-spawn.sh`'s claude launch path, the one owner for both.
Accepting the dialog for a git worktree persists under the repository's own checkout path in `~/.claude.json`, never the worktree's own path, so every other worktree of an already-trusted repository launches with no dialog at all; firstmate never edits that file itself.
A spawn that cannot clear the dialog, or clears it without confirming the launch brief resumed processing, fails loudly with `failed: claude's workspace-trust dialog could not be cleared` or `failed: claude accepted the workspace-trust dialog but never confirmed it started processing the launch brief` in `state/<id>.status` rather than leaving a silently idle pane; treat that like any other failed spawn (inspect the pane, `stuck-crewmate-recovery` if it recurs).

## Composer ghost

Completed turns can render dim predicted text inside an empty composer, indistinguishable in plain `tmux capture-pane`.
The spawn scopes `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false` to every Claude worker and secondmate without changing global config.
CLI `--prompt-suggestions` affects print or SDK mode only and did not suppress interactive ghost text on v2.1.186.

As defense in depth, `fm_composer_strip_ghost` in `../../../bin/fm-composer-lib.sh` removes SGR-2 runs before pending classification on styled tmux, Herdr, and Zellij readers.
`../../../docs/herdr-backend.md` under "Composer and injection safety" owns dark-TRUECOLOR tradeoffs and `../../../docs/verification/runtime-backends.md` owns captures.
Styled capture stays internal to the boolean detector; `fm-peek` and model-facing captures remain plain, without escapes.

## Primary integration

Primary behavior was verified 2026-07-04 on 2.1.201, preserved 2026-07-08 on 2.1.204, and Stop auto-arm revalidated 2026-07-24 on 2.1.219.
This differs from the worker hook, which only touches a task marker through `.claude/settings.local.json`.

Primary `.claude/settings.json` registers `../../../bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude` and `../../../bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh` with `asyncRewake: true` and `timeout: 28800`.
Guard exit 2 plus stderr forces continuation.
Stop payload `stop_hook_active=true` follows any hook-driven continuation, including async reawakening, so Claude mode ignores it and uses cooperative claim and epoch plus bounded re-block; default Codex mode keeps it as a one-block loop guard.

Project `.claude/settings.json` loads only when the exact project root is the session root; Claude does not search parents, so Firstmate starts at repository root.
Hooks still run through cwd-sensitive `/bin/sh`, so tracked commands anchor through `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/bin/...`.
`../../../docs/turnend-guard.md` owns details.

The Stop-owned watcher hook runs every Stop, foregrounds `../../../bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` only when eligible, and uses exit-2 async reawakening as notification.
The model handles notifications but never routine re-arm.
Claude's PreToolUse seatbelt blocks directly, and its deny is honored only with empty stdout; `../../../docs/arm-pretool-check.md` owns that contract.

### Delegation guard

Claude delegation, scheduling, and worktree tools can create work without `state/<id>.meta`, making guards unable to count it.
`../../../bin/fm-subagent-pretool-check.sh` denies delegation-shaped tool names.
A primary should also keep an untracked home-local `permissions.deny` for known delegation tools so they disappear from the schema.
Never track it in project `.claude/settings.json`, which is Claude-only and propagates to worker copies where it would disarm legitimate delegation.
`../../../docs/subagent-guard.md` owns the contract, recommendation, `FM_ALLOW_SUBAGENT=1`, and applicability review.

On Claude 2.1.217 the tool presents as `Agent`, and both `Agent` and `Task` worked as deny keys in an A/B with nonsense control.
`permissions.allow` pre-approves rather than controls availability, so no closed positive allowlist exists.
