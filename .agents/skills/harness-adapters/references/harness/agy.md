# Antigravity CLI

Antigravity's `agy` TUI, verified end to end on 2026-09-10 with agy 1.2.0 on Linux through the Herdr backend.
Verified as a CREWMATE and SCOUT adapter only; `../../../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` refuses a secondmate launch on it because `../../../../../docs/supervision-protocols/` carries no agy wake protocol.
`../../../../../docs/verification/agy.md` owns how every fact below was established and what is still unproven.

## Operating facts

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Binary | Absolute `agy` from `PATH`, refused if absent; a Go-compiled single binary, so the live process name is exactly `agy` with `argv[0]=agy`. |
| Launch | `agy --prompt-interactive "<brief>" --model <id> --effort <level> --dangerously-skip-permissions`, with the resolved absolute binary; the brief auto-submits with no extra Enter. The spawn then answers the folder-trust dialog and waits for a busy turn before reporting success. |
| Busy state | No hook or plugin writer, so nothing is armed and no record is seeded; on Herdr the native `working` status classifies busy, and everywhere else the `agy-regex` rendered-tail fallback in `../../../../../bin/fm-busy-lib.sh` does. |
| Rendered tail | Busy status row carries `esc to cancel` on the left; the idle row shows `? for shortcuts` instead. The `Generating...` word beside the braille spinner is free-floating output and is not a signal. |
| Turn end | No turn-end hook or notification touch exists; completion arrives through the worker status protocol and, on Herdr, the native return to `idle`. |
| Exit | `/quit`, one Enter; the process exits. |
| Interrupt | Single `Escape`, which prints the Interrupted row and leaves an idle composer with no repollution, so no clear key follows. |
| Skill | No verified slash-skill form; use natural language. |
| Autonomy | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` auto-approves tool calls for the run. |
| Marker | None; a live TUI carries no `AGY_*` or `ANTIGRAVITY_*` variable. |
| Resume | `--continue` and `--conversation` exist but carry no verified pane-resume contract; use deterministic relaunch. |
| Model | `--model <id>` with the bare catalog id from `agy models` (for example `gemini-3.8-flash-high`); `bin/fm-spawn.sh` refuses a requested id a reachable listing omits. The listing is a remote fetch, so the probe runs stdin-detached under the shared hard bound and an unreachable or hung listing launches unvalidated with a notice. |
| Effort | `--effort low\|medium\|high`; `xhigh` and `max` stay in task metadata under the record-and-omit contract. |
| Composer | Borderless bare `>` row, which the shared classifier reads as `unknown` under the dead-shell rule, never `empty`; steering confirms delivery through native agent-state and the delivery footer instead, the cursor precedent. |

## Trust, and where the decision persists

Every task worktree is a path agy has never seen, so the launch stops on `Do you trust the contents of this project?` with the safe choice `Yes, I trust this folder` preselected.
An unanswered dialog sends the turn into agy's scratch directory instead of the worktree, so `../../../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` owns the answer: its post-launch readiness gate answers the dialog with a single Enter the first time it renders, then requires a busy verdict (Herdr's native `working` status or the pinned `esc to cancel` row) before the spawn reports success.
A dialog that never turns busy fails the spawn, records the failure in the task status, and closes the endpoint; a reused path shows no dialog and passes on the busy verdict alone.
Never steer into a pane still showing the dialog; a spawn that reported success has already cleared it.
Accepting appends the worktree to `trustedWorkspaces` in the captain's own `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`, so firstmate never writes that file and the decision survives for reused paths.
There is no launch flag that suppresses the dialog, and it must not be bypassed by pre-writing the captain's settings.

## Credential precondition

A verified agy worker ran under a signed-in Google account with no key export and no dialog.
The unauthenticated failure mode was not observed, so treat any auth prompt or refusal as a credential blocker under `../../../../../AGENTS.md` section 9, fix the environment, and retire the endpoint rather than typing into it.

## Detection

Detected by ancestry alone: `../../../../../bin/fm-harness.sh` matches the anchored process name `agy`, never `*agy*`.
No environment marker is promoted: `AGENT=1` observed on a live TUI is an inherited launcher value, not an agy identity, and agy does not clear an inherited `CLAUDECODE`, so the spawn clears foreign markers at the launch boundary and the ancestry arm decides.
agy is deliberately absent from the session-lock name vocabulary in `../../../../../bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh`, where muse, gemini, and rovo are also absent: a crewmate-only adapter must never own a home session lock.

## Worker busy state and turn end

`../../../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` arms no busy generation for agy and writes no sidecar, exactly because no writer could ever clear a seeded record.
`fm_busy_agy_tail_busy` matches the pinned `esc to cancel` status row alone, hardcoded with no environment override, and `fm_busy_classify` reports `unknown agy-regex` rather than idle when it is absent, because a long turn can scroll the marker out of the captured tail.
Teardown removes nothing agy-specific because the spawn leaves nothing behind.

## Primary integration

Unsupported and unverified.
`../../../../../docs/supervision-protocols/` carries no agy protocol, no turn-end guard adapter exists for it, and this adapter verified only the crewmate-side launch, busy state, interrupt, and exit.
`references/common/primary-hooks.md`'s unsupported-boundary rule applies: never invent a wake protocol from a similar TUI.
