# Dispatch axes: harness, model, and effort

Read this at crewmate, scout, or secondmate intake, when resolving which harness to launch and which concrete model and effort values to pass to `bin/fm-spawn.sh`.

Crewmates default to the same harness firstmate is running on unless `config/crew-harness` records an adapter name.
Optional dispatch profiles in `config/crew-dispatch.json` can override that static default for one crewmate or scout dispatch by selecting concrete harness, model, and effort axes at intake.
When a matched rule or default is a profile array, load `quota-array-dispatch` for the completion-aware candidate choice after this skill establishes harness and model/provider facts.
The captain may override that file at session start or later; a per-task instruction such as "run this one on codex" overrides it for that dispatch only.
`default` means mirror firstmate's own harness.

Secondmates have their own harness knob, so a secondmate can run on a different adapter than crewmates.
`config/secondmate-harness` is the harness the primary uses to launch SECONDMATE agents, resolved through the fallback chain `config/secondmate-harness` -> `config/crew-harness` -> firstmate's own.
An absent or `default` `config/secondmate-harness` therefore behaves exactly as the crew harness did before this knob existed (secondmates launched on the crew harness); setting it splits the two.
The [`secondmate-provisioning` skill](../secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md) owns the complete inherited-local-material allowlist and propagation contract.
This skill owns only the harness-relevant consequence: a secondmate's own crewmates use the primary's inherited dispatch profiles and static harness value, while `config/secondmate-harness` is the primary's own setting and is never inherited - secondmates do not spawn secondmates.
Inheritance copies the literal `config/crew-harness` file, so for a secondmate's own crewmates to run on the primary's crewmate harness the captain must set `config/crew-harness` to a concrete adapter name, such as `codex`.
If `config/crew-harness` is unset or `default`, there is no concrete value to inherit, so the secondmate's own crewmates fall back to the secondmate's own/detected harness rather than the primary's effective crewmate harness.
Inheritance also copies the literal `config/crew-dispatch.json` file, so secondmates apply the same best-fit profile rules for their own crewmates.

## Launch profile axes

`bin/fm-spawn.sh` accepts concrete `--harness`, `--model`, and `--effort` values chosen by firstmate at intake.
Do not make the shell scripts parse or match natural-language dispatch rules.

Effort precedence is an explicit per-task captain instruction first, then any applicable standing dispatch profile or secondmate pin, then the generic fallback below.
Never replace an effort value supplied by either higher-precedence source.
Use the fallback only when neither the captain nor applicable standing configuration specifies effort.
Use `low` for well-understood work with an explicit bounded path and `xhigh` for ambiguous investigation or design.
Choose intermediate levels proportionally as complexity, uncertainty, blast radius, or open-ended reasoning increases.
When a verified adapter lacks `xhigh`, cap the choice at its highest supported non-`max` level rather than omitting the intended effort silently.
Never select `max` from this fallback; use it only when the captain has explicitly expressed that per-task or standing preference.

The supported launch-profile flags below are verified locally; each row records its evidence.

| Harness | Model flag | Effort flag | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| claude | `--model <model>` | `--effort <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max>` | Verified on Claude Code 2.1.196. |
| codex | `--model <model>` | `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="<low\|medium\|high\|xhigh>"'` | Verified on codex-cli 0.142.1. The installed binary schema contains `model_reasoning_effort`, the active config uses it, and the bundled model catalog advertises only low/medium/high/xhigh. `max` is omitted. |
| grok | `--model <model>` | `--reasoning-effort <low\|medium\|high>` | Verified on grok 0.2.99 (2026-07-13). `--effort` is an alias, but firstmate's profile axis is reasoning effort. As of 0.2.99 the ceiling is `high`; both `xhigh` and `max` are rejected with `use one of: high, medium, low`, so firstmate omits them. |
| pi / pi-signed | `--model <model>` | `--thinking <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max>` | Verified 2026-07-27 on Pi and pi-signed 0.82.0. Both expose the same accepted thinking levels and completed the same model-qualified max-thinking smoke. |
| opencode | `--model <provider/model>` | none for firstmate's interactive launch | Verified on opencode 1.17.6. `opencode run` has `--variant`, but firstmate launches the interactive `opencode --prompt` path, which has no verified effort flag. |
| kimi | `--model <model>` | none | Verified 2026-07-25 on Kimi Code CLI 0.29.1. |
| muse | `--model <model>` | `--reasoning-effort <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh>`, and `ultra` only for an explicit `max` | Verified 2026-08-05 on Muse Code 0.1.0-R708.1. The flag accepts `none\|minimal\|low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|ultra` and defaults to `high`. `ultra` is muse's max-class level, so it is reachable only through an explicit captain `max`, never from the generic fallback; `none` and `minimal` sit below the shared vocabulary and stay unreachable. |

The concrete `harness` field owns adapter identity independently of the model provider: `harness=pi` with `model=xai/grok-*` is Pi using xAI, not `harness=grok`, and does not require Grok CLI login; `harness=grok` remains the standalone Grok Build CLI adapter.
No script resolves that split for you: establish which credential store a tuple reads from the discovery surfaces below plus `quota-axi auth --json`'s per-provider sources, and show that reasoning rather than inferring it from a harness, model, or source name.

### Model support discovery

Treat model and provider knowledge as current source-of-truth discovery, not as a permanent namespace or provider mapping.
Use the discovery surface in the current authenticated environment because supported and available models can change by version, account, and configuration.

| Harness | Authoritative discovery surface |
|---|---|
| claude | Open the current interactive session's `/model` picker; `claude --help` documents the accepted alias or full-model-name input shape. |
| codex | Open the current interactive session's `/model` picker. |
| opencode | Run `opencode models [provider]`, which lists available provider/model identifiers. |
| pi / pi-signed | Run the selected executable as `<executable> --list-models [search]`; Pi's installed `docs/models.md` owns how built-in, extension-registered, and custom provider/model entries reach that list. |
| grok | Run `grok models`, which lists the models available to the current Grok installation and account. |
| kimi | Run `kimi provider list --json`, which lists the current provider and model configuration. |

For an unfamiliar harness or model namespace, establish support and provider identity from that harness's authoritative CLI help, model listing, or current documentation rather than guessing from a name or prefix.
A listing that reaches the account and does not contain the model is concrete evidence the model is unsupported: block that candidate and quote the result.
A discovery surface you could not reach establishes nothing; report that as uncertainty rather than turning it into a supported or unsupported verdict.

When a requested effort value is outside the harness-specific accepted set, `fm-spawn` records the requested `effort=` in meta but emits no effort flag for that harness.
This preserves launch success instead of passing a known-bad value.
