## codex (VERIFIED 2026-06-11, codex-cli 0.139.0)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy state | Unknown until a semantic source is live-verified: the app-server turn lifecycle is unreachable for a pane worker, and project lifecycle hooks did not fire for a firstmate-launched worker. |
| Exit command | `/quit` (slash popup needs about 1 second between text and Enter; the shared submit path used by `fm-control` handles it) |
| Interrupt | single Escape |
| Skill invocation | `$<skill>` (e.g. `$no-mistakes`); `/<skill>` is claude-only and codex rejects it as "Unrecognized command" |

A `$<skill>` invocation opens a `$`-autocomplete (skill) popup, the same hazard as the `/` slash popup: submitting too fast lets the popup swallow the Enter, so the invocation never lands.
`fm-send` handles it the same way it handles `/` - it gives the popup a longer settle (1.2s) between typing and the first Enter, with the target backend's submit retry as the safety net - but the `$` settle is scoped to `harness=codex`, read from the target metadata for exact task ids or legacy `fm-<id>` labels.
That scope matters because, unlike `/`, a leading `$` commonly starts ordinary text (`$5/month`, `$HOME`), so a universal `$` rule would needlessly slow plain steers to claude/opencode/pi; only a codex target receiving a `$...` message gets the popup-settle.
An explicit `session:window` target has no meta, so its harness is unknown and treated as non-codex (the safe fast-path default).
This is why the validation trigger (`$no-mistakes`) to a codex crew now lands on the first Enter instead of biting the popup.

Directory trust dialog on first run per repo root: "Do you trust the contents of this directory?"
Accept with Enter.
The decision persists for the repo, so later worktrees of the same project skip it.

Resume after exit with `codex resume <session-id>`.
The session id is printed on quit.

**Primary-session guard fact (verified 2026-07-08, codex-cli 0.142.1).**
The firstmate PRIMARY's own `.codex/hooks.json` registers a Stop hook that pipes Codex's Stop payload to `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
Codex Stop hooks block on exit 2 and expose `stop_hook_active` for the same one-block loop safety Claude uses.
Codex's Stop payload includes `cwd`, but the tracked primary hook does not use it to choose the guard executable.
Verified on 2026-07-08: Codex runs the Stop hook command with process PWD set to the hook-loaded project root, and no `CODEX_PROJECT_DIR`, `CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, or `CODEX_CWD` root variable is set.
The tracked hook anchors to `pwd -P`, verifies that root is firstmate-shaped and hook-bearing, and then invokes `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` with the original payload.
Codex's primary watcher protocol is `bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh --seconds "${FM_CODEX_WATCH_CHECKPOINT:-180}"`, not `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`.
The checkpoint is deliberately foreground and bounded so Codex regains control regularly to process user messages and queued wakes.
