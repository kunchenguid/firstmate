## opencode (VERIFIED 2026-06-11, v1.15.7-1.17.6; 1.18.4 busy-queue re-verified 2026-07-20)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy state | The Firstmate-owned plugin's semantic `session.status`: `busy` and `retry` are active, `idle` is inactive, latched to the worker's own session. |
| Exit command | `/exit` |
| Interrupt | double Escape; known flaky while a long shell command runs, so a wedged pane may need `/exit` and relaunch |

No trust dialog.
Opencode can auto-upgrade itself in the background and the running TUI can exit mid-task, observed live from 1.15.7 to 1.17.3.
If a pane shows the exit banner, relaunch with `--continue` to resume the session.
`--prompt` does not auto-submit alongside `--continue`, so send the next instruction via `fm-send` once the TUI is up.

**Busy-queued Enter (opencode 1.18.4, tmux backend fix, herdr known gap).**
While opencode is mid-turn, the composer accepts Enter as a "send when the turn
ends" keystroke but does not clear the typed text from the composer until the
turn actually finishes.
Without a fix, every `fm-send` to a busy opencode pane exits non-zero on a
false "Enter swallowed", and every daemon escalation that lands while the
primary is mid-turn is treated as wedged.
The shared `fm_tmux_submit_enter_core` (`bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh`) now falls back
to `fm_pane_is_busy` once the Enter-retry budget is spent: a busy pane means
the Enter was accepted and queued (reported as `empty` so the caller does not
re-send), while an idle pane keeps `pending` as a genuine swallow. The herdr
adapter observes the same opencode behavior but needs a separate fix; it is
recorded as a known gap in `docs/herdr-backend.md` rather than patched here,
so the tmux adapter does not paper over a herdr-specific shape.
Regression coverage: `tests/fm-tmux-submit-busy.test.sh` covers the four
scenarios (busy + pending -> `empty`, idle + pending -> `pending`, busy +
cleared -> `empty`, idle + cleared -> `empty`).

**Primary-session guard fact (verified 2026-07-08, OpenCode 1.17.6).**
The firstmate PRIMARY's own `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-turnend-guard.js` listens for `session.idle`.
Throwing from `session.idle` does not block `opencode run`, so the primary adapter treats the event as passive and uses `client.session.promptAsync` to force one follow-up turn when `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` returns 2.
The companion `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js` owns normal TUI watcher wake supervision and coordinates with the guard plugin before the guard tries a blind-turn follow-up.
The follow-up was verified in the interactive TUI; `opencode run` can exit before displaying a queued follow-up, so the adapter is fail-open in headless mode.
